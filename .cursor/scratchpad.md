## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Source Code Review - May 2025

### File Structure Analysis
After a thorough review of the source code, I can confirm our project follows a clean, modular architecture:

```
frontend/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/              # UI Components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/                # Blog-specific components
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HomePage.svelte  # Home page with latest 5 posts

â”œâ”€â”€ global.css               # Global styles and CSS variables
â””â”€â”€ main.js                  # App initialization and routing
```

### Data Management
The blog has been successfully migrated to a modular data structure:

1. **Blog Posts Organization**:
   - Each post is split into metadata (in `/posts`) and content (in `/content`)
   - Metadata includes title, date, tags, author info, and getContent method
   - Content is stored as Markdown files for better maintainability

2. **Utility Functions**:
   - `blog-utils.js` provides helper functions for post retrieval and formatting
   - `getAllPosts()` combines posts from both old and new systems
   - Utility functions for consistent date formatting and reading time

3. **Post Content**:
   - All 7 Ravencoin blog posts are fully implemented
   - Consistent author and metadata structure across posts
   - Dynamic content loading to improve performance

### Component Implementation
The key components have been implemented with a focus on matching the target site's layout:

1. **HomePage.svelte**:
   - Now uses `getAllPosts()` to display the 5 most recent posts
   - Layout matches the target site with proper spacing and typography
   - Proper display of post metadata (date, tags, etc.)

2. **BlogPostPage.svelte & BlogListPage.svelte**:
   - Updated to use the new modular data structure
   - Support for Markdown rendering
   - Similar styling to the target site

### Routing
The app uses page.js for client-side routing with a clean URL structure:
- `/` - Home page
- `/blog` - Blog listing page
- `/blog/:slug` - Individual blog post
- `/tags` - Tags listing page
- `/tags/:tag` - Posts filtered by tag
- `/projects` - Projects listing
- `/projects/:id` - Individual project
- `/about` - About page

## Next Steps

Based on the code review, here are the recommended next steps to enhance the blog further:

### 1. Component Extraction & Reusability
- Create a reusable `PostCard` component for consistent post previews across HomePage and BlogListPage
- Extract `TagChip` component for consistent tag styling
- Develop a proper Footer component (currently minimal in App.svelte)

### 2. UI Enhancements
- Implement code block syntax highlighting for blog posts
- Add social sharing buttons to blog posts
- Create a table of contents component for long articles
- Implement a newsletter subscription component

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Add lazy loading for images
- Implement prefetching for smoother navigation
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting

### 4. Missing Features
- Create a proper 404 page component
- Implement proper error states for content loading
- Add pagination for blog listings

### 5. Accessibility Improvements
- Fix identified accessibility issues (e.g., in SearchDialog.svelte)
- Add proper ARIA attributes to interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout the app

### 6. Content Enhancement
- Add relevant images to blog posts
- Create a series landing page that lists all related posts
- Implement better related posts suggestions based on tags

### High-priority Tasks

1. **Create PostCard Component**:
   - Extract common post preview logic from HomePage and BlogListPage
   - Ensure consistent styling and behavior

2. **Enhance Mobile Experience**:
   - Optimize touch targets for mobile users
   - Improve responsive layouts for all pages

3. **Fix Accessibility Issues**:
   - Address the warning about click handlers on non-interactive elements
   - Improve keyboard navigation throughout the app

## Lessons Learned
- Vanilla CSS requires more planning for maintainability than utility-first frameworks
- Component-scoped CSS in Svelte helps maintain style isolation
- Custom CSS properties (variables) are essential for building a themeable site
- Media queries require careful planning for responsive breakpoints
- When using Svelte 4, be careful not to use Svelte 5 or SvelteKit features
- Component implementation best practices:
  - Start extremely simple and add complexity gradually
  - Test components in isolation before integration
  - Avoid circular dependencies between components
  - Mock data locally before using complex stores
  - When a component doesn't work, revert to simplest possible version
- Page structure lessons:
  - Keep separate pages as separate components
  - Don't mix homepage and blog page content/layouts
  - Study the reference site carefully to understand the distinct layout needs of each page
- Development workflow:
  - Include info useful for debugging in program output
  - Read files before attempting to edit them
  - Run npm audit when vulnerabilities appear in the terminal
  - Always ask before using -force git commands
- Data management lessons:
  - Store large content outside of JavaScript files when possible
  - Split related data into logical chunks
  - Implement lazy loading for content that isn't needed immediately
  - Consider dynamic imports for better performance
