# Modern Blog with Svelte 4 and Vanilla CSS

## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Finding Svelte 4 Documentation
To ensure we're using Svelte 4 correctly (not Svelte 5 or SvelteKit), we'll rely on these specific resources:

1. **Official Svelte 4 Documentation**: Available at https://v4.svelte.dev/docs - this is the definitive resource for Svelte 4 specifically
2. **Svelte 4 Tutorial**: The interactive tutorial at https://v4.svelte.dev/tutorial
3. **Svelte 4 Examples**: The REPL at https://v4.svelte.dev/repl for testing code snippets
4. **Svelte 4 Blog Post**: The official announcement at https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-4 highlights key features

When searching for help online, always include "Svelte 4" in search queries to avoid getting results for newer versions. If viewing Stack Overflow or blog posts, check their publication dates to ensure they're relevant to Svelte 4.

## README.md Requirements

To properly document our Svelte 4 blog project, we would update the README.md file to include:

1. **Project Overview**: A brief description of the blog, its features, and the technologies used (Svelte 4, vanilla CSS)
2. **Installation Instructions**: How to clone the repository and install dependencies
3. **Development Instructions**: Commands to run the development server and build for production
4. **Project Structure**: An explanation of the key directories and their purposes
5. **Content Management**: How to add new blog posts using Markdown
6. **Customization**: How to customize styles and components
7. **Tags Feature Implementation**: Details about the tagging system (see below)
8. **Deployment**: Instructions for deploying the blog to hosting platforms
9. **Credits and License**: Attribution and licensing information

## Codebase Analysis
The existing codebase contains:
- Basic Svelte 4 project structure with rollup configuration
- A Header component with navigation, search, and theme toggle
- Global CSS with custom properties for theming
- App shell structure

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Content Management**: Implementing Markdown parsing in Svelte 4 for blog content
2. **Routing**: Setting up client-side routing without relying on SvelteKit
3. **Styling System**: Creating a maintainable CSS architecture without Tailwind's utility classes
4. **Static Site Generation**: Creating a build process for pre-rendering pages
5. **SEO and Social Sharing**: Ensuring proper metadata and social sharing
6. **Code Syntax Highlighting**: Adding syntax highlighting for code blocks in blog posts

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration ‚úÖ

## CSS Architecture Approach
The implemented CSS architecture uses:

1. **CSS Custom Properties**: For theming, responsive values, and maintaining consistency ‚úÖ
2. **Component-Based CSS**: Styles scoped to Svelte components using Svelte's style encapsulation ‚úÖ
3. **Global Styles**: A minimal set of global styles for typography, layout utilities, and reset ‚úÖ
4. **Media Queries**: For responsive design ‚úÖ
5. **CSS Animations**: For interactive elements and transitions ‚úÖ
6. **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: For layout without relying on utility classes ‚úÖ

## Project Status Board
- [x] Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration
  - [x] Task 1.1: Ensure correct Svelte 4 setup
  - [x] Task 1.2: Create CSS architecture
  - [ ] Task 1.3: Set up Markdown processing
- [ ] Phase 2: Routing and Core Structure
  - [x] Task 2.1: Create header component
  - [ ] Task 2.2: Implement client-side routing
  - [ ] Task 2.3: Create footer component

## Required Dependencies
- Svelte 4 (not Svelte 5 or SvelteKit) ‚úÖ
- A routing library like page.js ‚úÖ (installed but not implemented)
- A Markdown parser like marked.js ‚è≥
- A syntax highlighter like Prism.js ‚è≥

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
The header component has been successfully implemented with theme switching functionality and responsive design. The next step should be implementing client-side routing with page.js to create the navigation structure for the blog.

## Lessons
- Vanilla CSS requires more planning for maintainability than utility-first frameworks
- Component-scoped CSS in Svelte helps maintain style isolation
- Custom CSS properties (variables) are essential for building a themeable site
- Media queries require careful planning for responsive breakpoints
- When using Svelte 4, be careful not to use Svelte 5 or SvelteKit features
- Always check the version compatibility of any Svelte plugins or libraries
