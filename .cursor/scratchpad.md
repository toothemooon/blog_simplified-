## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Current State Analysis and Implementation Plan

### Current State Analysis

The blog project has made significant progress with many core features implemented, but faces several challenges with internationalization:

1. **i18n Build Errors**: The current build is failing with "t is not exported" error from i18n/store.js referenced in i18n/index.js.
2. **Search Functionality Limitations**: Current search implementation strips non-Latin characters, making it ineffective for Japanese and Chinese content.
3. **Content Translation Gap**: While UI components can be translated, actual content (blog posts, projects) lacks proper translation structure.

### Strategic Approach: Simplified Navigation Path

I've evaluated your suggested implementation order (About -> Projects -> Tags -> Blog -> Homepage -> 404 page) and find it's a strong approach for these reasons:

1. **Complexity Gradient**: Starts with simpler, more static pages before tackling complex content-heavy pages
2. **Quick Wins**: About page provides a fast implementation victory to validate the i18n approach
3. **Logical Progression**: Each page builds on patterns established in previous pages
4. **User Experience**: Core navigation path will be fully translated before tackling specialized features

### Phase 1: Fix Critical i18n Infrastructure (1 day)

**Priority Task: Fix the "t is not exported" build error**

Looking at the code, the issue is likely with how the translation function is exported from store.js. The fix should:
1. Ensure proper export of the `t` derived store in store.js
2. Fix the import in index.js 
3. Update components to correctly import and use the translation function

**Action Items:**
1. Fix store.js export - ensure `t` derived store is properly exported
2. Test with a simple component before proceeding with full implementation

**Success Criteria**: Build completes without errors, simple text translations work correctly

### Phase 2: Page-by-Page Implementation

#### 1. About Page (1 day)
The About page is an ideal starting point as it's relatively static with predictable content.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Update page title with translation key
- Translate biographical content sections
- Create language-specific versions of professional details
- Implement translation for social media link labels
- Test thoroughly with language switching

**Success Criteria**: About page fully translated and functional in all supported languages

#### 2. Projects Section (2 days)
The Projects section introduces more complexity with content structure but builds on patterns from the About page.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create standardized translation template for project metadata
- Update fields to include language-specific versions:
  ```javascript
  {
    title: "Project Title",
    title_ja: "プロジェクトタイトル",
    title_zh: "项目标题",
    // Additional project fields with language variants
  }
  ```
- Make components language-aware to pick correct version based on user selection
- Implement fallback to English for missing translations

**Success Criteria**: Projects display correctly in all languages with proper metadata

#### 3. Tags Page (1 day)
The Tags page introduces challenges with dynamic content filtering.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Create translations for page title and UI elements
- Implement tag translation system with language-specific names
- Update tag filtering to respect current language
- Ensure tag cloud visualization works with translated tags

**Success Criteria**: Tags display correctly in all languages with proper filtering

#### 4. Blog Section (3 days)
The Blog section is more complex with rich content and multiple components.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Update blog post data structure with language-specific fields
- Implement language-aware content rendering
- Create translations for metadata (date formats, reading time, etc.)
- Add language-specific routing for blog posts
- Implement content availability indicators

**Success Criteria**: Blog posts display correctly in selected language

#### 5. Homepage (2 days)
The Homepage combines multiple components already translated.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Translate static welcome text and section headings
- Ensure recent posts section displays language-appropriate content
- Implement language-specific featured content
- Harmonize all translated components

**Success Criteria**: Homepage provides cohesive experience in all languages

#### 6. 404 and Error Pages (1 day)
Error pages complete the core navigation experience.

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Translate error messages and suggestions
- Make error handling language-aware
- Test boundary conditions in all languages

**Success Criteria**: Error pages properly guide users in their selected language

### Phase 3: Search Enhancement (2 days)

After completing the core navigation, we'll tackle search functionality:

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Fix text normalization to preserve non-Latin characters
2. Implement language-filtered search to only return results in current language
3. Test with various languages and queries

### Phase 4: Polish and Optimization (ongoing)

Final phase for refining the implementation:

1. **Visual consistency**: Ensure consistent styling across languages
2. **Performance optimization**: Implement efficient handling of language assets
3. **Layout testing**: Verify proper display with varying text lengths
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure proper a11y support across languages

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix the "t" export issue in i18n/store.js**:
   - Review the implementation to ensure proper export
   - Test with a simple component to verify translations work

2. **Create standardized translation template**:
   - Define required fields for each content type
   - Document the approach for content translation

3. **Begin About page implementation**:
   - Update with translation function
   - Create translations for all text content

## Test Plan

For each page, test:
1. Language switching works correctly
2. All text elements appear in the correct language
3. Layout handles variable text length appropriately
4. Fallbacks work for any missing translations
5. Performance is acceptable during language switches

This phased approach will allow incremental progress while maintaining a functional site throughout the internationalization process.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Progress Update (About Page Implementation):**
1. Fixed the "t is not exported" build error - the code now builds successfully
2. Added translation keys for the About page in all three language files (en, ja, zh)
3. Updated the AboutPage.svelte component to use the translation function for all text content
4. The development server is now running and we can test the language switching functionality

**Next Steps:**
1. Verify that the About page displays correctly in all three languages
2. Continue with the Projects pages implementation once the About page is confirmed working

## Lessons

1. **Direct Import Strategy**: Use direct imports for translations rather than dynamic imports
2. **JSON Configuration**: Ensure Rollup is properly configured to handle JSON files
3. **Simple First**: Start with simple, synchronous approaches before adding complexity
4. **Test Incrementally**: Implement and test one component at a time
5. **Debug Output**: Include temporary debug output during development
6. **Translation Structure**: Maintain consistent structure across all language files
7. **Content-First Approach**: Focus on translating content before enhancing search

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Persistent "t is not exported" Error

Despite making changes to the About page, we're still encountering a build error: `"t" is not exported by "src/i18n/store.js", imported by "src/i18n/index.js"`. This suggests there's a deeper issue with how the translation function is being exported and imported.

Two possible solutions to investigate:
1. **Modified Export Approach**: Change how the `t` function is exported from store.js, possibly using a named export rather than exporting it as part of a derived store.
2. **Direct Import Strategy**: Update components to import directly from store.js rather than through the index.js barrel file.

This needs to be resolved before proceeding with further implementation.

### Projects Section i18n Strategy

The Projects section presents unique challenges compared to the About page:

1. **Dynamic Content Structure**: Projects have multiple data fields (title, description, technologies, etc.) that need translation.
2. **Content-Rich Display**: Project details often contain longer-form content with formatting requirements.
3. **Multiple View Components**: We need to update both the Projects list view and individual Project detail pages.

### Project Data Structure Analysis

Looking at the current project data structure, we need to enhance it to support multiple languages while maintaining compatibility with existing components. The recommended approach is:

#### Current Structure (simplified):
```javascript
{
  id: "project-1",
  title: "Project Title",
  description: "Project description in English",
  // Other fields...
}
```

#### Proposed Multilingual Structure:
```javascript
{
  id: "project-1",
  title: "Project Title", // Keep original for backward compatibility
  title_ja: "プロジェクトタイトル",
  title_zh: "项目标题",
  description: "Project description in English",
  description_ja: "日本語のプロジェクト説明",
  description_zh: "项目描述中文版",
  // Other fields with language variants...
}
```

This approach:
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing components
- Avoids nested structures that could complicate component logic
- Provides a straightforward path for adding additional languages later

**Success Criteria:**
- Projects section functions correctly in all supported languages
- Layout remains consistent despite language differences
- No untranslated text appears in the UI

## Implementation Approach

The most effective approach for this implementation is to:

1. **Fix Core i18n Infrastructure First**: We must fix the "t is not exported" issue before proceeding
2. **Start with Data Structure**: Update the project data structure to support multiple languages
3. **One Component at a Time**: Update components incrementally, testing each one thoroughly
4. **Use Helper Functions**: Create reusable helpers for language-specific field selection
5. **Focus on User Experience**: Ensure a consistent experience across languages

This approach will allow us to make steady progress while maintaining a working application throughout the process.
