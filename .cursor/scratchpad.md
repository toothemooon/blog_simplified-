Based on a thorough analysis of the frontend codebase, here's a comprehensive assessment of the project architecture, components, and key areas that need attention.

### Project Structure Overview

The project follows a well-organized, modular structure:

### Key Components Analysis

1. **Routing System (main.js)**
   - Uses page.js for client-side routing
   - Routes are defined centrally and mapped to view states
   - Routes include: /, /blog, /blog/:slug, /tags, /tags/:tag, /projects, /projects/:id, /about

2. **Component Architecture**
   - Components are organized by feature domain
   - Each component handles its own styling with Svelte's scoped CSS
   - Components use i18n translation through the `$t` store for text content

3. **Data Management**
   - Blog posts use a modular approach with separate metadata and content files
   - Content is loaded dynamically via imports for better performance
   - Bridge utilities support both new modular and legacy flat data structures

4. **Styling Approach**
   - Uses vanilla CSS with CSS variables for theming
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Light/dark mode support via CSS custom properties

### Internationalization Implementation

The project uses a custom i18n system with three languages: English, Japanese, and Chinese:

1. **Translation Store**
   - `language` writable store tracks the current language
   - `t` derived store provides reactive translations
   - Translations are loaded directly from JSON files
   - Language preference is persisted in localStorage

2. **Translation Files**
   - Structured JSON files for each language
   - Keys organized hierarchically (e.g., "nav.blog")
   - Support for parameter interpolation (e.g., "{{year}}")

3. **Usage in Components**
   - Components use `$t(key)` for reactive translations
   - Non-reactive contexts use `translate(key)` function

4. **Tag Translation**
   - `getLocalizedTagName` functions in utility files
   - Translation keys follow pattern "tags.{tagName}"

### Navigation System

1. **Header Component**
   - Main navigation implemented in Header.svelte
   - Links defined in NavLinks.svelte with translation keys
   - Active link styling based on current route

2. **Route Handling**
   - Routes defined in main.js with page.js
   - Route parameters passed to components as props
   - Components render appropriate content based on props

### Identified Issues

1. **i18n Export Issue**
   - In i18n/index.js, the 't' export seems correctly defined, but there's an issue with how it's being processed by Rollup
   - Error: `"t" is not exported by "src/i18n/store.js", imported by "src/i18n/index.js"`
   - Direct import and re-export approach should work but isn't

2. **Route Inconsistencies**
   - NavLinks.svelte has `/projects` route, but main.js uses `/projects-list`
   - This mismatch could cause navigation issues

3. **Tag Translation Reactivity Issues**
   - Components using tag translations have potential reactivity issues
   - Current implementation struggles with language switching

4. **Search Limitations for Non-Latin Characters**
   - The search.js normalizeText function strips non-alphanumeric characters
   - This affects search functionality for Japanese and Chinese content

5. **Tag Display Inconsistencies**
   - Different components use different approaches to display tags
   - Some use direct calls to getLocalizedTagName, others attempt reactive solutions

### Rollup Configuration

The rollup.config.js is well-structured with proper plugin ordering:

1. JSON processing first, with special handling for i18n files
2. Plugin for markdown content
3. Node resolution and CommonJS conversion
4. Svelte processing
5. CSS extraction
6. Development utilities

The configuration explicitly includes JSON files from the i18n/locales directory, which is crucial for the internationalization system.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Fix i18n Export Issue**
   - Simplify the export/import chain in i18n files
   - Consider explicitly handling the exports without reusing names
   - Direct import/export approach:
     ```javascript
     // In store.js - export more directly
     export const translationFunction = derived(
       language,
       $language => createTranslationFunction($language)
     );
     
     // In index.js - rename and export explicitly
     import { translationFunction as storeTranslationFunction } from './store.js';
     export const t = storeTranslationFunction;
     ```

2. **Standardize Route Names**
   - Ensure route names in main.js match NavLinks.svelte
   - Consider using constants for route names to avoid mismatches

3. **Improve Tag Translation System**
   - Implement a more robust reactive solution for tag translations
   - Consider using derived stores consistently across components

4. **Enhance Search for International Content**
   - Update text normalization to preserve non-Latin characters
   - Implement language-aware search techniques

5. **Standardize Component Best Practices**
   - Create and document patterns for handling translations
   - Establish consistent approaches for reactive data
   - Implement error boundaries for robust error handling

## Current Status and Next Steps

### Current Status

Based on the codebase analysis, the project is well-structured with a solid foundation, but has critical issues with internationalization that affect functionality. The primary focus should be on fixing the i18n export issue to enable proper component rendering with translations.

### Next Steps

1. Fix the i18n export issue:
   - Update store.js and index.js with a direct, unambiguous export pattern
   - Test with a simple component to verify translations work

2. Standardize route names:
   - Align route definitions in main.js with link references in NavLinks.svelte
   - Test navigation flow to ensure all links work correctly

3. Implement a robust tag translation solution:
   - Update the tag translation utilities
   - Standardize the approach across all components
   - Test with language switching

4. Enhance search for international content:
   - Update text normalization in search.js
   - Test with Japanese and Chinese content

5. Create project documentation:
   - Document i18n usage patterns
   - Create examples for component implementers

This roadmap addresses the critical issues while preserving the existing architecture and design patterns of the project.

## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Lessons

1. **Direct Import Strategy**: Use direct imports for translations rather than dynamic imports
2. **JSON Configuration**: Ensure Rollup is properly configured to handle JSON files
3. **Simple First**: Start with simple, synchronous approaches before adding complexity
4. **Test Incrementally**: Implement and test one component at a time
5. **Debug Output**: Include temporary debug output during development
6. **Translation Structure**: Maintain consistent structure across all language files
7. **Content-First Approach**: Focus on translating content before enhancing search
8. **Field Naming Convention**: Use consistent suffix approach (_en, _ja, _zh) for multilingual fields
9. **Fallback Strategy**: Always implement language fallbacks to English for missing translations

### Current Status
The core functionality has been fixed, addressing the most critical issues in the codebase. The changes ensure:

1. Better reactivity when language changes, with derived stores updating properly
2. More robust search functionality that works with all supported languages
3. Consistent implementation of i18n features across components
4. Improved error handling and fallbacks

### Next Steps
1. Test the changes thoroughly with all supported languages
2. Verify that tag translation updates properly when switching languages
3. Update the project components to use the same reactive patterns
4. Consider consolidating some of the translation logic into a single location for easier maintenance
5. Add proper translation keys for all UI text that's currently hardcoded

### Open Questions
1. Should we automate the creation of tag stores to simplify component code?
2. Is there a more efficient way to handle the tag stores to prevent duplicate stores?
