## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Comparison with Target Site

After reviewing both the current blog-simplified site at https://blog-simplified.vercel.app/ and our target reference https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/, I've identified the following gaps and opportunities for improvement:

### What We've Accomplished
- âœ… Basic layout structure mirroring the target site
- âœ… Responsive design with proper mobile optimization
- âœ… Blog post detail pages with navigation between posts
- âœ… Tags system with tag cloud and filtering
- âœ… Search functionality with keyboard shortcuts
- âœ… Proper metadata display (dates, reading time, authors)
- âœ… Fixed accessibility issues in key components
- âœ… Mobile navigation slide-in menu

### What's Missing Compared to Target Site

1. **Projects Section**:
   - The Projects page appears to be showing 404 errors
   - Target site has a dedicated Projects section showcasing various projects

2. **Newsletter Subscription**:
   - Target site has a newsletter subscription component in the footer
   - Our site lacks this engagement feature

3. **Social Media Links**:
   - Target site has comprehensive social media links in the footer
   - Our implementation has minimal or no social presence

4. **Code Block Styling**:
   - Target site has syntax highlighting for code blocks
   - Our implementation has basic code styling

5. **Series/Collection Display**:
   - Target site organizes related posts into series with navigation
   - Our Ravencoin series exists but lacks a dedicated series landing page

6. **Pagination**:
   - Target site has pagination for the blog list
   - Our implementation shows all posts on a single page

7. **Visual Polish**:
   - Target site has more refined spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
   - Our site has the basics but could use more visual refinement

8. **Website Metadata**:
   - Target site has proper SEO metadata, favicons, and social sharing images
   - Our implementation appears to be missing some of these elements

## Plan for Moving Forward

Based on the comparison, here is a prioritized plan to bring our implementation closer to the target site's quality and features:

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Completion (High Priority)

1. **Implement Projects Section**:
   - Create ProjectsPage.svelte and ProjectDetailPage.svelte components
   - Implement project data structure in src/data/projects/
   - Add routing for /projects and /projects/:id

2. **Add Basic Footer with Social Links**:
   - Create Footer.svelte component with site information
   - Add social media links with proper icons
   - Implement consistent styling matching the header

3. **Fix 404 Pages and Routing**:
   - Create a custom 404 page component
   - Ensure all routes are properly handled
   - Add proper redirects for common mistyped URLs

4. **Add Pagination to Blog List**:
   - Implement pagination controls in BlogListPage.svelte
   - Allow users to navigate through blog posts in chunks
   - Add URL parameter support for page numbers

### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience (Medium Priority)

5. **Implement Newsletter Subscription**:
   - Create NewsletterSignup.svelte component
   - Add form validation and submission handling
   - Integrate with a service like Mailchimp or a mock API

6. **Add Code Block Syntax Highlighting**:
   - Implement or integrate a syntax highlighting library
   - Add language detection for code blocks
   - Style code blocks to match target site aesthetics

7. **Create Series/Collection Pages**:
   - Add series metadata to post structure
   - Create SeriesPage.svelte to display posts in a series
   - Add navigational elements to browse between series posts

8. **Improve Website Metadata**:
   - Add proper SEO meta tags
   - Create and add favicon and social sharing images
   - Implement OpenGraph and Twitter card metadata

### Phase 3: Visual Refinement and Polish (Lower Priority)

9. **Refine Typography and Spacing**:
   - Audit and refine typography across all components
   - Ensure consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
   - Improve contrast and readability

10. **Add Animations and Transitions**:
    - Implement subtle page transitions
    - Add micro-interactions for improved UX
    - Ensure animations are accessible (respecting reduced motion preferences)

11. **Optimize Performance**:
    - Implement lazy loading for images
    - Add prefetching for linked pages
    - Optimize bundle size and loading performance

12. **Enhance Dark Mode**:
    - Refine dark mode color palette
    - Ensure all components handle theme switching properly
    - Add smooth transition between themes

## Implementation Approach

For each phase:

1. **Start with Component Design**:
   - Design components on paper/wireframes first
   - Define clear responsibilities and props
   - Identify reusable patterns

2. **Implement Core Functionality**:
   - Start with minimal viable implementation
   - Focus on functionality before styling
   - Write clear component documentation

3. **Apply Styling and Responsiveness**:
   - Implement styling following global CSS patterns
   - Test on multiple screen sizes
   - Ensure consistent with existing components

4. **Test and Refine**:
   - Validate against accessibility guidelines
   - Test with real content and edge cases
   - Refine based on visual comparison with target site

## Lessons Learned
- Vanilla CSS requires more planning for maintainability than utility-first frameworks
- Component-scoped CSS in Svelte helps maintain style isolation
- Custom CSS properties (variables) are essential for building a themeable site
- Media queries require careful planning for responsive breakpoints
- When using Svelte 4, be careful not to use Svelte 5 or SvelteKit features
- Component implementation best practices:
  - Start extremely simple and add complexity gradually
  - Test components in isolation before integration
  - Avoid circular dependencies between components
  - Mock data locally before using complex stores
  - When a component doesn't work, revert to simplest possible version
- Page structure lessons:
  - Keep separate pages as separate components
  - Don't mix homepage and blog page content/layouts
  - Study the reference site carefully to understand the distinct layout needs of each page
- Development workflow:
  - Include info useful for debugging in program output
  - Read files before attempting to edit them
  - Run npm audit when vulnerabilities appear in the terminal
  - Always ask before using -force git commands
- Data management lessons:
  - Store large content outside of JavaScript files when possible
  - Split related data into logical chunks
  - Implement lazy loading for content that isn't needed immediately
  - Consider dynamic imports for better performance
- CSS warnings about unused selectors in BlogPostPage are expected and can be ignored
  - These selectors target dynamically loaded Markdown content
  - Document this in the code to avoid future confusion
- A11y warnings should be addressed promptly
  - Elements with event handlers should be interactive elements or have proper ARIA roles
  - Use proper semantic HTML elements whenever possible
- Having a reference site is extremely valuable for design implementation
  - Study both desktop and mobile layouts separately
  - Pay attention to subtle details like spacing and typography
  - Use browser dev tools to inspect the reference implementation
