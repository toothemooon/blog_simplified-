## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Projects Section Implementation

The Projects section has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### Project Data Structure

The project data follows a modular system similar to our blog posts:

```
frontend/src/
└── data/
    └── projects/
        ├── index.js             # Central management file for projects
        ├── projects/            # Project metadata files
        │   ├── ravencoin.js
        │   ├── cgc-overseas.js
        │   └── chengda.js
        └── content/             # Detailed content files
            ├── ravencoin.md
            ├── cgc-overseas.md
            └── chengda.md
```

### Components

1. **ProjectsPage.svelte**
   - List view displaying all projects in predefined order
   - Each project shows title, role, location, period, summary, and tags
   - Project items link to their respective detail pages

2. **ProjectDetailPage.svelte**
   - Detailed view of a single project
   - Displays comprehensive metadata including project type, field, and team size
   - Shows achievements as bullet points
   - Features related projects section based on matching tags
   - Includes 'Back to projects' navigation

3. **Project Metadata Structure**
   - Each project has standardized fields (title, role, location, period, slug, etc.)
   - Tags system allows linking related projects
   - Content is stored in separate markdown files for better management

### Utility Functions

Project-specific utility functions have been added to `project-utils.js`:
- `getAllProjects()`: Returns all projects in the configured order
- `getProject(slug)`: Retrieves a specific project by slug
- `formatProjectPeriod(period)`: Formats date periods consistently (e.g., "Jan 2018" → "January 2018")
- `getRelatedProjectsBySlug(slug, limit)`: Finds related projects based on matching tags

### Recent Enhancements

1. **Project Ordering**
   - Projects are now ordered with most recent/ongoing projects at the top
   - Order: Ravencoin (ongoing), Chengda, CGC Overseas

2. **Focus Visibility Improvements**
   - Enhanced focus states for better accessibility
   - Added `:focus-visible` support for keyboard-only focus indicators
   - Removed default focus outlines on mouse clicks while preserving them for keyboard navigation

3. **Chinese Character Handling**
   - Fixed display issues with Chinese characters in project titles

## Language Translation Implementation Plan

After analyzing different approaches, we've determined the best strategy for adding language translation to the blog:

### Recommended Approach: Custom JSON Translation

This approach provides the most reliable solution that works across all browsers, devices, and regions (including China where Google services may be blocked):

1. **Translation Data Structure**
   ```
   frontend/src/
   └── i18n/
       ├── index.js           # Translation store setup
       └── locales/           # Translation files by language
           ├── en.json        # English (default)
           ├── zh.json        # Chinese
           └── ja.json        # Japanese
   ```

2. **Translation Store**
   - Create a Svelte store that manages the current language
   - Dynamically load language files as needed
   - Provide a translation function for easy component usage
   - Persist language selection in localStorage

3. **Language Selector UI**
   - Add a language toggle button next to the theme toggle
   - Show language options with appropriate flags/labels
   - Indicate the currently selected language

4. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Start with translating UI elements (navigation, buttons, labels)
   - Progressively translate content, starting with most important sections
   - For untranslated content, offer a fallback to English

This approach ensures:
- Works on all browsers and devices
- Functions in all regions, including China
- No dependency on third-party services
- Complete control over translation quality
- Best performance without additional scripts

  - Start with UI elements, then progressively translate content
  - Consider region-specific needs when implementing features
- SPA routing configuration:
  - Client-side routing requires proper server configuration
  - The sirv server needs the `--single` flag to handle SPA routing correctly
  - For production deployments, modify vercel.json to ensure proper SPA routing
  - Testing routes that don't exist is crucial for verifying 404 handling
- SVG icon considerations:
  - For solid icons, use `fill="currentColor"` instead of `stroke="currentColor"`
  - Provide clear accessibility attributes (aria-label) for icon-only links
  - Optimize icon paths for cleaner rendering
  - Consider icon size and spacing for proper visual balance
- Social media link implementation:
  - Always use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` with `target="_blank"` for security
  - Test links with actual accounts to ensure they work properly
  - Maintain consistent visual style across different platform icons
  - Group similar links together for better organization

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

## Footer Component Responsive Design Improvements

Based on the current implementation of the Footer.svelte component and the observed issue on mobile devices where the X icon appears isolated on its own row, here are the necessary improvements for better responsive design:

### Current Issues
1. **Inconsistent Icon Wrapping**: On narrow mobile screens, the social media icons are breaking at awkward points with the X icon appearing alone on a second row
2. **Spacing Not Optimized for Mobile**: The current gap spacing between icons may be too large for small screens
3. **Fixed Width Constraints**: The current max-width setting may be causing unintended wrapping behavior

### Proposed Solutions

#### 1. Improve Layout Structure
- Replace the current flex-wrap approach with a more structured grid layout for predictable wrapping
- Implement a responsive grid using CSS Grid with auto-fit to ensure icons display evenly across rows
- Example:
  ```css
  .social-links {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(40px, 1fr));
    gap: 0.75rem;
    max-width: 100%;
    justify-content: center;
  }
  ```

#### 2. Responsive Spacing Adjustments
- Reduce spacing between icons on smaller screens
- Use proportional units instead of fixed values for gap spacing
- Implement a progressive spacing approach where gap decreases as screen width decreases

#### 3. Consistent Width Control
- Ensure each social link element has the same dimensions to prevent uneven wrapping
- Set a min/max width constraint on individual icon containers

#### 4. Additional Breakpoints
- Add more specific breakpoints to handle various device sizes
- Current breakpoint at 640px is not sufficient for handling very small screens
- Add breakpoints for:
  - Small phones (< 375px)
  - Regular phones (375px - 480px)
  - Large phones/small tablets (480px - 640px)

#### 5. Visual Testing Strategy
- Test implementations on various device sizes:
  - iPhone SE (smallest common iPhone)
  - Standard mobile (375px width)
  - Large mobile (390-428px width)
  - Tablet (768px width)
  - Desktop (1024px+ width)

### Implementation Plan
1. First attempt: Modify current flex layout with better spacing controls
2. If flex layout still causes issues, implement grid-based layout
3. Test on multiple viewports to ensure consistent icon placement
4. Verify that no icons appear isolated on their own row

## Specific Implementation Options

### Current Issues in the Code

1. The current implementation uses:
   ```css
   .social-links {
     display: flex;
     flex-wrap: wrap;
     justify-content: center;
     gap: 1.25rem;
     max-width: 70%;
     margin: 0 auto;
   }
   ```

2. Problems with this approach:
   - The `gap: 1.25rem` is too large for mobile screens
   - The `max-width: 70%` creates a container that's too narrow on small screens
   - There's only one media query at 640px which isn't sufficient for mobile devices

### Specific Implementation Options

#### Option 1: Improved Flexbox Layout (Preferred First Approach)

```svelte
<style>
  /* ... existing styles ... */
  
  .social-links-container {
    width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
  }
  
  .social-links {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    /* Reduced gap for mobile */
    gap: 0.75rem;
    /* Full width on mobile for better distribution */
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 300px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  
  .social-link {
    display: inline-flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    color: var(--color-text);
    transition: color 0.2s ease;
    /* Fixed width and height to ensure consistent sizing */
    width: 32px;
    height: 32px;
    opacity: 0.7;
  }
  
  /* ... other styles ... */
  
  /* Progressive enhancement with multiple breakpoints */
  @media (min-width: 375px) {
    .social-links {
      gap: 0.875rem;
    }
  }
  
  @media (min-width: 480px) {
    .social-links {
      gap: 1rem;
      max-width: 350px;
    }
  }
  
  @media (min-width: 640px) {
    .social-links {
      gap: 1.25rem;
      max-width: 450px;
    }
  }
</style>
```

#### Option 2: Grid-Based Layout (Alternative if Flexbox Doesn't Resolve the Issue)

```svelte
<style>
  /* ... existing styles ... */
  
  .social-links-container {
    width: 100%;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
  }
  
  .social-links {
    display: grid;
    /* Creates a responsive grid that adapts to available space */
    /* Each icon takes minimum 40px and they distribute evenly */
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(40px, 1fr));
    gap: 0.75rem;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 280px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  
  .social-link {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    color: var(--color-text);
    transition: color 0.2s ease;
    /* Ensure consistent sizing */
    aspect-ratio: 1/1;
    opacity: 0.7;
  }
  
  .social-icon {
    width: 24px;
    height: 24px;
  }
  
  /* ... other styles ... */
  
  /* Progressive enhancement with multiple breakpoints */
  @media (min-width: 375px) {
    .social-links {
      max-width: 300px;
    }
  }
  
  @media (min-width: 480px) {
    .social-links {
      gap: 1rem;
      max-width: 350px;
    }
  }
  
  @media (min-width: 640px) {
    .social-links {
      gap: 1.25rem;
      max-width: 450px;
    }
  }
</style>
```

#### Option 3: Fixed Number of Icons per Row

If we want to ensure a specific number of icons per row on different screen sizes:

```svelte
<style>
  /* ... existing styles ... */
  
  .social-links {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    gap: 1rem;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 300px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  
  .social-link {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    color: var(--color-text);
    transition: color 0.2s ease;
    /* Each link takes exactly 1/3 of container width on smallest screens */
    /* This ensures 3 icons per row */
    width: calc((100% - 2rem) / 3);
    height: 32px;
    opacity: 0.7;
  }
  
  /* ... other styles ... */
  
  @media (min-width: 375px) {
    .social-link {
      /* Adjust if needed for this breakpoint */
      width: calc((100% - 2rem) / 3);
    }
  }
  
  @media (min-width: 480px) {
    .social-links {
      max-width: 350px;
    }
    .social-link {
      /* On larger screens, we can have 4 per row */
      width: calc((100% - 3rem) / 4);
    }
  }
  
  @media (min-width: 640px) {
    .social-links {
      max-width: 450px;
      gap: 1.25rem;
    }
    .social-link {
      /* On even larger screens, all can fit in one row */
      width: auto;
    }
  }
</style>
```

### Implementation Recommendation

1. Start with the improved flexbox layout (Option 1) as it's closest to the current implementation and requires minimal changes.

2. Test on mobile devices at various widths to ensure the icons wrap properly.

3. If issues persist, implement the grid-based layout (Option 2) which provides more consistent distribution of icons.

4. For the most controlled layout, use Option 3 which enforces a specific number of icons per row.

The key improvements in all approaches are:
- Smaller gaps on mobile screens
- Consistent icon sizing
- Multiple breakpoints for progressive enhancement
- Better width management to prevent awkward wrapping

These changes will ensure that social media icons in the footer display properly across all device sizes, preventing the issue where the X icon appears isolated on its own row.

## Component Folder Review and Implementation Strategy

Before implementing new components or making changes to existing ones (like the Footer component responsive design improvements), it's important to conduct a thorough review of the component structure. This ensures that new implementations follow established patterns and maintain consistency across the codebase.

### Component Folder Review Checklist

#### 1. Directory Structure Analysis
- Examine the organization of components by functionality or feature
- Note how nested components are structured (parent-child relationships)
- Identify special directories for shared/common components
- Check for any specific naming conventions used in the project

```
frontend/src/
└── components/
    ├── blog/              # Blog-specific components
    ├── projects/          # Project-specific components
    ├── header/            # Header-related components
    ├── search/            # Search-related components
    ├── error/             # Error-related components
    ├── AboutPage.svelte   # Standalone page components
    ├── Header.svelte      # Main composite components
    └── Footer.svelte      # Main composite components
```

#### 2. Component Implementation Patterns
- Examine representative components to identify common patterns:
  - Script organization (imports, exports, reactive declarations)
  - Markup structure (nested elements, conditional rendering)
  - Style conventions (scoped CSS, CSS variables, responsive breakpoints)
- Check for component-specific conventions like:
  - How props are defined and documented
  - Event handling and dispatching
  - Lifecycle methods usage
  - State management approach

#### 3. Dependency and Import Analysis
- Identify shared utilities and services
- Note common dependencies between components
- Check for circular dependencies that should be avoided
- Understand how components communicate with each other

#### 4. Responsive Design Approach
- Analyze existing breakpoints and media queries
- Identify common responsive patterns
- Note any mobile-first or desktop-first approach
- Check for consistent handling of different screen sizes

#### 5. CSS Methodology
- Note CSS organization within components
- Identify any CSS variables or theming system
- Check for consistent naming of CSS classes
- Review how responsive styles are implemented

#### 6. Component Documentation
- Look for any inline documentation or comments
- Check for props documentation patterns
- Note any testing patterns or test files
- Identify examples of well-documented components to follow

### Implementation Preparation Steps

After reviewing the component folder structure, follow these steps before implementation:

1. **Create an implementation plan** that:
   - Follows the established patterns found in the review
   - Maintains consistency with existing components
   - Addresses the specific requirements of the new feature

2. **Identify similar components** that:
   - Solve similar problems to what you're implementing
   - Can be referenced as examples or templates
   - Have reusable patterns or utilities

3. **Document design decisions** including:
   - Why certain approaches were chosen
   - Any deviations from existing patterns (with justification)
   - Responsiveness considerations
   - Accessibility features

4. **Plan for testing** with:
   - Visual testing on different screen sizes and devices
   - Functional testing of interactive elements
   - Accessibility testing for keyboard navigation, screen readers, etc.
   - Performance considerations

### Footer Component Implementation Insights

Based on a review of the project's components, the best approach for the Footer component redesign incorporates these insights:

1. **CSS Methodology**: The project uses component-scoped CSS with a set of global CSS variables for colors, spacing, and breakpoints defined in `global.css`.

2. **Breakpoint Patterns**: The existing components use these consistent breakpoint ranges:
   - Mobile: Base styles (< 640px)
   - Tablet: `@media (min-width: 640px)`
   - Desktop: `@media (min-width: 1024px)`

3. **Container Width Pattern**: Components typically use `max-width` with responsive adjustments:
   ```css
   max-width: var(--container-width-sm); /* Mobile */
   
   @media (min-width: 640px) {
     max-width: var(--container-width-md); /* Tablet */
   }
   
   @media (min-width: 1024px) {
     max-width: var(--container-width-lg); /* Desktop */
   }
   ```

4. **Responsive Grid Patterns**: For consistent layouts, components use either:
   - Flexbox with `flex-wrap` for simpler layouts
   - CSS Grid with `grid-template-columns` for more complex layouts
   - Consistent gap spacing that adjusts based on screen size

Using these insights, the Footer component improvements should:
- Utilize the CSS variables for consistent spacing and colors
- Follow the established breakpoint pattern
- Implement either improved flexbox or grid layout
- Ensure consistent styling with other components
- Make sure social links display properly across all device sizes
