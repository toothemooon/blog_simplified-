# Modern Blog with Svelte 4 and Vanilla CSS

## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Finding Svelte 4 Documentation
To ensure we're using Svelte 4 correctly (not Svelte 5 or SvelteKit), we'll rely on these specific resources:

1. **Official Svelte 4 Documentation**: Available at https://v4.svelte.dev/docs - this is the definitive resource for Svelte 4 specifically
2. **Svelte 4 Tutorial**: The interactive tutorial at https://v4.svelte.dev/tutorial
3. **Svelte 4 Examples**: The REPL at https://v4.svelte.dev/repl for testing code snippets
4. **Svelte 4 Blog Post**: The official announcement at https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-4 highlights key features

When searching for help online, always include "Svelte 4" in search queries to avoid getting results for newer versions. If viewing Stack Overflow or blog posts, check their publication dates to ensure they're relevant to Svelte 4.

## README.md Requirements

To properly document our Svelte 4 blog project, we would update the README.md file to include:

1. **Project Overview**: A brief description of the blog, its features, and the technologies used (Svelte 4, vanilla CSS)
2. **Installation Instructions**: How to clone the repository and install dependencies
3. **Development Instructions**: Commands to run the development server and build for production
4. **Project Structure**: An explanation of the key directories and their purposes
5. **Content Management**: How to add new blog posts using Markdown
6. **Customization**: How to customize styles and components
7. **Tags Feature Implementation**: Details about the tagging system (see below)
8. **Deployment**: Instructions for deploying the blog to hosting platforms
9. **Credits and License**: Attribution and licensing information

### Tags Feature Requirements

To implement the tags feature similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/tags, we would need:

1. **Tag Metadata in Posts**: Each Markdown post should include a `tags` array in its frontmatter
2. **Tags API Endpoint**: A function to collect all unique tags across all blog posts with their counts
3. **Tags Index Page**: A page that displays all tags with counts, similar to the reference site
4. **Tag-Specific Pages**: Dynamic routes for each tag (e.g., `/tags/[tag]`) to display all posts with that tag
5. **Tag Styling**: CSS for tag buttons/pills, including hover states and count indicators
6. **Tag Filtering Logic**: JavaScript functions to filter posts by tag
7. **Tag Navigation**: Navigation elements to move between the main tags page and individual tag pages

To feel 100% confident in implementing the tags feature, we would need:

1. **Complete Understanding of Routing**: Clear grasp of client-side routing in Svelte 4 (without SvelteKit)
2. **Data Management Strategy**: Defined approach for loading and aggregating tag data across posts
3. **Dynamic Page Generation**: Method for generating dynamic tag-specific pages without server-side rendering
4. **Performance Testing**: Plan for testing performance with a large number of posts and tags
5. **UI/UX Design**: Detailed mockups for the tags pages and components
6. **Accessibility Considerations**: Ensuring tag links and interactive elements are fully accessible
7. **SEO Strategy**: Approach for making tag pages discoverable by search engines

## Codebase Analysis
The existing codebase contains a basic Svelte component (`frontend/src/App.svelte`). We'll build upon this foundation to create our blog. Using Svelte 4 with vanilla CSS offers several advantages:

1. **Lighter Bundle Size**: Without Tailwind's utility classes, our CSS will be more focused and potentially smaller
2. **Svelte's Built-in Reactivity**: Svelte 4's compile-time approach results in highly optimized DOM updates
3. **Simpler Learning Curve**: Vanilla CSS is familiar to most developers without requiring knowledge of Tailwind's utility-first paradigm
4. **Complete Styling Control**: Custom CSS allows pixel-perfect implementation without constraints of a framework

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Content Management**: Implementing Markdown parsing in Svelte 4 for blog content
2. **Routing**: Setting up client-side routing without relying on SvelteKit
3. **Styling System**: Creating a maintainable CSS architecture without Tailwind's utility classes
4. **Static Site Generation**: Creating a build process for pre-rendering pages
5. **SEO and Social Sharing**: Ensuring proper metadata and social sharing
6. **Code Syntax Highlighting**: Adding syntax highlighting for code blocks in blog posts

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration
1. Ensure correct Svelte 4 setup with necessary dependencies
   - Success Criteria: Confirm project is using Svelte 4 with proper rollup/webpack configuration

## CSS Architecture Approach
Instead of Tailwind's utility classes, we'll implement a thoughtful CSS architecture:

1. **CSS Custom Properties**: For theming, responsive values, and maintaining consistency
2. **Component-Based CSS**: Styles scoped to Svelte components using Svelte's style encapsulation
3. **Global Styles**: A minimal set of global styles for typography, layout utilities, and reset
4. **Media Queries**: For responsive design rather than Tailwind's responsive utility classes
5. **CSS Animations**: For interactive elements and transitions
6. **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: For layout without relying on utility classes

## Lessons
- Vanilla CSS requires more planning for maintainability than utility-first frameworks
- Component-scoped CSS in Svelte helps maintain style isolation
- Custom CSS properties (variables) are essential for building a themeable site
