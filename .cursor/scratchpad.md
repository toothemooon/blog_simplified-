## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

### Current Issues Identified
1. **Accessibility Warning in SearchDialog.svelte**:
   - Non-interactive `<div>` element has click and keyboard event listeners
   - Needs proper role or should be changed to button element
   
2. **Unused CSS Selectors in BlogPostPage.svelte**:
   - Multiple CSS selectors like `.post-content h1` are flagged as unused
   - These selectors are actually used for dynamically loaded Markdown content
   - Need to document in the code that these warnings can be safely ignored

3. **Mobile Responsiveness Improvements**:
   - Some components still need mobile-specific optimizations
   - Text overflow issues on smaller screens in some components

## Bug Fix Plan - High Priority Issues

After reviewing the code and IDE warnings, I'll focus on resolving the following issues in order of priority:

### 1. Fix SearchDialog.svelte Accessibility Issue (A11y Warning)

**Problem:** The SearchDialog component uses a non-interactive `<div>` element with click and keyboard event listeners, which triggers an accessibility warning.

**Solution:** Modify the SearchDialog component to use proper semantic elements with appropriate ARIA attributes:

1. Review the current implementation at lines 140-144
2. Either:
   - Change the `<div>` to a more semantic element like `<button>` or
   - Add appropriate ARIA attributes (role, tabindex) to make it accessible
3. Test keyboard navigation to ensure it works correctly
4. Ensure focus management follows accessibility best practices

**Success Criteria:**
- No A11y warnings in the console
- The search dialog can be navigated using a keyboard
- Screen readers can properly interpret the dialog

### 2. Address "Unused CSS Selectors" in BlogPostPage.svelte

**Problem:** Multiple CSS selectors in BlogPostPage.svelte are flagged as "unused" because they target dynamically rendered Markdown content.

**Solution:** Add explicit documentation in the component to clarify that these selectors are intentional:

1. Add a detailed comment block at the beginning of the CSS section explaining that these selectors target dynamically loaded content
2. Create a system to suppress these specific warnings, if possible
3. Update the code documentation to explain this pattern

**Success Criteria:**
- Clear documentation in the code explaining the purpose of these selectors
- Team understanding that these warnings can be safely ignored
- No confusion for future developers

### 3. Optimize Mobile Typography and Word Breaking

**Problem:** Some text elements may overflow their containers on small screens.

**Solution:** Add proper word-breaking properties to ensure text displays correctly on all screen sizes:

1. Review text-heavy components for potential overflow issues
2. Add or enhance word-breaking properties in global styles
3. Test on small screen sizes

**Success Criteria:**
- No horizontal overflow on mobile screens
- Text wraps appropriately without breaking layout
- All content is readable on small screens

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Fix Accessibility Issue in SearchDialog.svelte

**Tasks:**
1. Examine the current implementation and understand its behavior
2. Modify the backdrop element to use proper semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
3. Ensure keyboard events still work as expected
4. Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

### Phase 2: Document CSS Selectors in BlogPostPage.svelte

**Tasks:**
1. Add a comprehensive comment block explaining the purpose of the "unused" selectors
2. Document this pattern in the project documentation
3. Consider adding a special comment format that could be detected by linting tools

**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

### Phase 3: Enhance Mobile Typography

**Tasks:**
1. Review text components on small screens
2. Enhance word-breaking and overflow handling in CSS
3. Test across multiple viewport sizes

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

## Technical Details

### 1. SearchDialog.svelte Fix

Current problematic code:
```svelte
<div 
  class="search-dialog-backdrop" 
  on:click={handleClickOutside}
  on:keydown={handleKeydown}
  role="dialog"
  aria-label="Search dialog"
>
```

Proposed fix:
```svelte
<div 
  class="search-dialog-backdrop" 
  on:click={handleClickOutside}
  on:keydown={handleKeydown}
  role="dialog"
  aria-label="Search dialog"
  tabindex="-1"
>
```

### 2. BlogPostPage.svelte Documentation

Add this comment block before the CSS section with "unused" selectors:
```svelte
<style>
  /* 
   * IMPORTANT: The following CSS selectors for .post-content elements
   * will be flagged as "unused" by the Svelte compiler. This is expected and can be safely ignored.
   * 
   * These selectors target HTML elements that are dynamically generated when rendering
   * Markdown content in the blog post. Since this content is loaded at runtime and not
   * statically defined in the template, Svelte can't detect the relationship.
   * 
   * Do not remove these selectors even if they appear unused!
   */
  
  .post-content h1 {
    /* styles... */
  }
  
  /* other selectors... */
</style>
```

## Lessons Learned
- Vanilla CSS requires more planning for maintainability than utility-first frameworks
- Component-scoped CSS in Svelte helps maintain style isolation
- Custom CSS properties (variables) are essential for building a themeable site
- Media queries require careful planning for responsive breakpoints
- When using Svelte 4, be careful not to use Svelte 5 or SvelteKit features
- Component implementation best practices:
  - Start extremely simple and add complexity gradually
  - Test components in isolation before integration
  - Avoid circular dependencies between components
  - Mock data locally before using complex stores
  - When a component doesn't work, revert to simplest possible version
- Page structure lessons:
  - Keep separate pages as separate components
  - Don't mix homepage and blog page content/layouts
  - Study the reference site carefully to understand the distinct layout needs of each page
- Development workflow:
  - Include info useful for debugging in program output
  - Read files before attempting to edit them
  - Run npm audit when vulnerabilities appear in the terminal
  - Always ask before using -force git commands
- Data management lessons:
  - Store large content outside of JavaScript files when possible
  - Split related data into logical chunks
  - Implement lazy loading for content that isn't needed immediately
  - Consider dynamic imports for better performance
- CSS warnings about unused selectors in BlogPostPage are expected and can be ignored
  - These selectors target dynamically loaded Markdown content
  - Document this in the code to avoid future confusion
- A11y warnings should be addressed promptly
  - Elements with event handlers should be interactive elements or have proper ARIA roles
  - Use proper semantic HTML elements whenever possible
