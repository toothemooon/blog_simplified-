## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Projects Section Implementation

The Projects section has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### Project Data Structure

The project data follows a modular system similar to our blog posts:

```
frontend/src/
└── data/
    └── projects/
        ├── index.js             # Central management file for projects
        ├── projects/            # Project metadata files
        │   ├── ravencoin.js
        │   ├── cgc-overseas.js
        │   └── chengda.js
        └── content/             # Detailed content files
            ├── ravencoin.md
            ├── cgc-overseas.md
            └── chengda.md
```

### Components

1. **ProjectsPage.svelte**
   - List view displaying all projects in predefined order
   - Each project shows title, role, location, period, summary, and tags
   - Project items link to their respective detail pages

2. **ProjectDetailPage.svelte**
   - Detailed view of a single project
   - Displays comprehensive metadata including project type, field, and team size
   - Shows achievements as bullet points
   - Features related projects section based on matching tags
   - Includes 'Back to projects' navigation

3. **Project Metadata Structure**
   - Each project has standardized fields (title, role, location, period, slug, etc.)
   - Tags system allows linking related projects
   - Content is stored in separate markdown files for better management

### Utility Functions

Project-specific utility functions have been added to `project-utils.js`:
- `getAllProjects()`: Returns all projects in the configured order
- `getProject(slug)`: Retrieves a specific project by slug
- `formatProjectPeriod(period)`: Formats date periods consistently (e.g., "Jan 2018" → "January 2018")
- `getRelatedProjectsBySlug(slug, limit)`: Finds related projects based on matching tags

### Recent Enhancements

1. **Project Ordering**
   - Projects are now ordered with most recent/ongoing projects at the top
   - Order: Ravencoin (ongoing), Chengda, CGC Overseas

2. **Focus Visibility Improvements**
   - Enhanced focus states for better accessibility
   - Added `:focus-visible` support for keyboard-only focus indicators
   - Removed default focus outlines on mouse clicks while preserving them for keyboard navigation

3. **Chinese Character Handling**
   - Fixed display issues with Chinese characters in project titles

## Language Translation Implementation Plan

After analyzing different approaches, we've determined the best strategy for adding language translation to the blog:

### Recommended Approach: Custom JSON Translation

This approach provides the most reliable solution that works across all browsers, devices, and regions (including China where Google services may be blocked):

1. **Translation Data Structure**
   ```
   frontend/src/
   └── i18n/
       ├── index.js           # Translation store setup
       └── locales/           # Translation files by language
           ├── en.json        # English (default)
           ├── zh.json        # Chinese
           └── ja.json        # Japanese
   ```

2. **Translation Store**
   - Create a Svelte store that manages the current language
   - Dynamically load language files as needed
   - Provide a translation function for easy component usage
   - Persist language selection in localStorage

3. **Language Selector UI**
   - Add a language toggle button next to the theme toggle
   - Show language options with appropriate flags/labels
   - Indicate the currently selected language

4. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Start with translating UI elements (navigation, buttons, labels)
   - Progressively translate content, starting with most important sections
   - For untranslated content, offer a fallback to English

This approach ensures:
- Works on all browsers and devices
- Functions in all regions, including China
- No dependency on third-party services
- Complete control over translation quality
- Best performance without additional scripts

## Comparison with Target Site

After reviewing both the current blog-simplified site at https://blog-simplified.vercel.app/ and our target reference https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/, I've identified the following gaps and opportunities for improvement:

### What We've Accomplished
- ✅ Basic layout structure mirroring the target site
- ✅ Responsive design with proper mobile optimization
- ✅ Blog post detail pages with navigation between posts
- ✅ Tags system with tag cloud and filtering
- ✅ Search functionality with keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Proper metadata display (dates, reading time, authors)
- ✅ Fixed accessibility issues in key components
- ✅ Mobile navigation slide-in menu
- ✅ Projects section with metadata and related projects

### What's Missing Compared to Target Site

1. **Newsletter Subscription**:
   - Target site has a newsletter subscription component in the footer
   - Our site lacks this engagement feature

2. **Social Media Links**:
   - Target site has comprehensive social media links in the footer
   - Our implementation has minimal or no social presence

3. **Code Block Styling**:
   - Target site has syntax highlighting for code blocks
   - Our implementation has basic code styling

4. **Series/Collection Display**:
   - Target site organizes related posts into series with navigation
   - Our Ravencoin series exists but lacks a dedicated series landing page

5. **Pagination**:
   - Target site has pagination for the blog list
   - Our implementation shows all posts on a single page

6. **Visual Polish**:
   - Target site has more refined spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
   - Our site has the basics but could use more visual refinement

7. **Website Metadata**:
   - Target site has proper SEO metadata, favicons, and social sharing images
   - Our implementation appears to be missing some of these elements
