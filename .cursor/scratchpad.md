## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Current Status Analysis - May 2025

### File Structure Analysis
The project follows a clean, modular architecture:

```
frontend/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/              # UI Components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/                # Blog-specific components
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HomePage.svelte  # Home page with latest 5 posts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BlogListPage.svelte
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BlogPostPage.svelte
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TagsPage.svelte

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog-data.js         # Legacy blog data (now empty array)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/                # New modular blog post system
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js         # Post management functionality
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ posts/           # Post metadata (7 Ravencoin articles)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content/         # Post content in Markdown
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ project-data.js
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                   # Utility functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog-utils.js        # Blog-specific utilities
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ search.js            # Search functionality

â”œâ”€â”€ global.css               # Global styles and CSS variables
â””â”€â”€ main.js                  # App initialization and routing
```

### Documentation Status
Comprehensive documentation has been added in the `frontend/docs` folder:
- âœ… `getting-started.md` - Installation and usage guide
- âœ… `data-architecture.md` - Explanation of the blog's modular content system
- âœ… `responsive-design.md` - Mobile-first design implementation details
- âœ… `troubleshooting.md` - Solutions for common issues
- âœ… `README.md` - Documentation index and project overview

### Current Issues Identified
1. **Accessibility Warning in SearchDialog.svelte**:
   - Non-interactive `<div>` element has click and keyboard event listeners
   - Needs proper role or should be changed to button element
   
2. **Unused CSS Selectors in BlogPostPage.svelte**:
   - Multiple CSS selectors like `.post-content h1` are flagged as unused
   - These selectors are actually used for dynamically loaded Markdown content
   - Need to document in the code that these warnings can be safely ignored

3. **Mobile Responsiveness Improvements**:
   - Some components still need mobile-specific optimizations
   - Text overflow issues on smaller screens in some components

## Next Steps

Based on the code review, here are the recommended next steps to enhance the blog further:

### 1. Component Extraction & Reusability
- Create a reusable `PostCard` component for consistent post previews across HomePage and BlogListPage
- Extract `TagChip` component for consistent tag styling
- Develop a proper Footer component (currently minimal in App.svelte)

### 2. UI Enhancements
- Implement code block syntax highlighting for blog posts
- Add social sharing buttons to blog posts
- Create a table of contents component for long articles
- Implement a newsletter subscription component

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- Add lazy loading for images
- Implement prefetching for smoother navigation
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting

### 4. Missing Features
- Create a proper 404 page component
- Implement proper error states for content loading
- Add pagination for blog listings

### 5. Accessibility Improvements
- Fix identified accessibility issues (e.g., in SearchDialog.svelte)
- Add proper ARIA attributes to interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout the app

### 6. Content Enhancement
- Add relevant images to blog posts
- Create a series landing page that lists all related posts
- Implement better related posts suggestions based on tags

## Lessons Learned
- Vanilla CSS requires more planning for maintainability than utility-first frameworks
- Component-scoped CSS in Svelte helps maintain style isolation
- Custom CSS properties (variables) are essential for building a themeable site
- Media queries require careful planning for responsive breakpoints
- When using Svelte 4, be careful not to use Svelte 5 or SvelteKit features
- Component implementation best practices:
  - Start extremely simple and add complexity gradually
  - Test components in isolation before integration
  - Avoid circular dependencies between components
  - Mock data locally before using complex stores
  - When a component doesn't work, revert to simplest possible version
- Page structure lessons:
  - Keep separate pages as separate components
  - Don't mix homepage and blog page content/layouts
  - Study the reference site carefully to understand the distinct layout needs of each page
- Development workflow:
  - Include info useful for debugging in program output
  - Read files before attempting to edit them
  - Run npm audit when vulnerabilities appear in the terminal
  - Always ask before using -force git commands
- Data management lessons:
  - Store large content outside of JavaScript files when possible
  - Split related data into logical chunks
  - Implement lazy loading for content that isn't needed immediately
  - Consider dynamic imports for better performance
- CSS warnings about unused selectors in BlogPostPage are expected and can be ignored
  - These selectors target dynamically loaded Markdown content
  - Document this in the code to avoid future confusion
- A11y warnings should be addressed promptly
  - Elements with event handlers should be interactive elements or have proper ARIA roles
  - Use proper semantic HTML elements whenever possible
