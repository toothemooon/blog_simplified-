## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Projects Section Implementation Plan

Based on the user's request, we'll implement a Projects section following a similar approach to the Ravencoin blog posts, focusing on layout and structure first. The implementation will mirror the structure of the Time Machine blog post from the reference site.

### Project Data Structure

We'll create a modular system for projects similar to our blog posts:

```
frontend/src/
└── data/
    └── projects/
        ├── index.js             # Central management file for projects
        ├── projects/            # Project metadata files
        │   ├── ravencoin.js
        │   ├── cgc-overseas.js
        │   └── chengda.js
        └── content/             # Detailed content files (for future implementation)
            ├── ravencoin.md
            ├── cgc-overseas.md
            └── chengda.md
```

### Project Metadata Structure

Each project will have a consistent metadata structure:

```javascript
// src/data/projects/projects/ravencoin.js
export default {
  title: 'Ravencoin (Volunteer Project)',
  role: 'Community Moderator',
  location: 'Remote',
  period: 'Jan 2018 – Present',
  slug: 'ravencoin',
  summary: 'Founded and managed the Chinese RVN community, promoting Ravencoin's growth and blockchain education in Chinese-speaking regions.',
  tags: ['blockchain', 'community', 'volunteer', 'translation'],
  metadata: {
    type: 'Volunteer Project',
    field: 'Blockchain',
    teamSize: 'Community-based',
    role: 'Community Moderator'
  },
  // For future detailed content
  getContent: () => import('../content/ravencoin.md')
}
```

### Component Implementation Plan

1. **ProjectsPage.svelte**
   - List view of all projects
   - Similar to BlogListPage but styled specifically for projects
   - Each project displayed as a card with key information

2. **ProjectDetailPage.svelte**
   - Detailed view of a single project
   - Similar layout to The Time Machine blog post
   - Structured sections for project details
   - Will initially just show the introduction

3. **Project Item Component Structure**
   - Title and period
   - Role and location
   - Project type/metadata
   - Summary and key achievements (bullet points)
   - Tags

      <a href="/projects">Return to projects list</a>
    </div>
  {/if}
</div>
```

### Routing Updates

Update App.svelte to include the project routes:

```svelte
<script>
  import page from 'page';
  import ProjectsPage from './components/projects/ProjectsPage.svelte';
  import ProjectDetailPage from './components/projects/ProjectDetailPage.svelte';
  
  // ... existing code
  
  // Projects routes
  page('/projects', () => {
    component = ProjectsPage;
    props = {};
  });
  
  page('/projects/:slug', (ctx) => {
    component = ProjectDetailPage;
    props = { slug: ctx.params.slug };
  });
  
  // ... existing code
</script>
```

### Utility Functions

Create a new file `project-utils.js` with functions:

```javascript
import { projects, getProjectBySlug } from '../data/projects';

/**
 * Get all projects
 */
export function getAllProjects() {
  return projects;
}

/**
 * Get a specific project by slug
 */
export async function getProject(slug) {
  const project = getProjectBySlug(slug);
  if (!project) return null;
  
  return project;
}
```

## Confidence Level for Implementation

With this detailed plan, I'm 100% confident we can implement the Projects section following the structure similar to the Ravencoin blog posts. The plan provides:

1. Clear data structure for the project metadata
2. Detailed component structure that aligns with the existing blog design
3. Implementation steps with time estimates
4. Specific project data to be included

This implementation focuses on layout and structure first, with the detailed content to be added later as requested. The structure mirrors The Time Machine blog post from the reference site, displaying metadata in a structured way similar to the reference.

## Next Steps

After approval of this plan, we'll proceed with:
1. Creating the project data files
2. Implementing the ProjectsPage and ProjectDetailPage components
3. Setting up the routing
4. Styling the components to match the site's aesthetic

## Comparison with Target Site

After reviewing both the current blog-simplified site at https://blog-simplified.vercel.app/ and our target reference https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/, I've identified the following gaps and opportunities for improvement:

### What We've Accomplished
- ✅ Basic layout structure mirroring the target site
- ✅ Responsive design with proper mobile optimization
- ✅ Blog post detail pages with navigation between posts
- ✅ Tags system with tag cloud and filtering
- ✅ Search functionality with keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Proper metadata display (dates, reading time, authors)
- ✅ Fixed accessibility issues in key components
- ✅ Mobile navigation slide-in menu

### What's Missing Compared to Target Site

1. **Projects Section**:
   - The Projects page appears to be showing 404 errors
   - Target site has a dedicated Projects section showcasing various projects

2. **Newsletter Subscription**:
   - Target site has a newsletter subscription component in the footer
   - Our site lacks this engagement feature

3. **Social Media Links**:
   - Target site has comprehensive social media links in the footer
   - Our implementation has minimal or no social presence

4. **Code Block Styling**:
   - Target site has syntax highlighting for code blocks
   - Our implementation has basic code styling

5. **Series/Collection Display**:
   - Target site organizes related posts into series with navigation
   - Our Ravencoin series exists but lacks a dedicated series landing page

6. **Pagination**:
   - Target site has pagination for the blog list
   - Our implementation shows all posts on a single page

7. **Visual Polish**:
   - Target site has more refined spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
   - Our site has the basics but could use more visual refinement

8. **Website Metadata**:
   - Target site has proper SEO metadata, favicons, and social sharing images
   - Our implementation appears to be missing some of these elements

## Plan for Moving Forward

Based on the comparison, here is a prioritized plan to bring our implementation closer to the target site's quality and features:

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Completion (High Priority)

   - Add language detection for code blocks
   - Style code blocks to match target site aesthetics

7. **Create Series/Collection Pages**:
   - Add series metadata to post structure
   - Create SeriesPage.svelte to display posts in a series
   - Add navigational elements to browse between series posts

8. **Improve Website Metadata**:
   - Add proper SEO meta tags
   - Create and add favicon and social sharing images
   - Implement OpenGraph and Twitter card metadata

### Phase 3: Visual Refinement and Polish (Lower Priority)

9. **Refine Typography and Spacing**:
   - Audit and refine typography across all components
   - Ensure consistent spacing and visual hierarchy
   - Improve contrast and readability

10. **Add Animations and Transitions**:
    - Implement subtle page transitions
    - Add micro-interactions for improved UX
    - Ensure animations are accessible (respecting reduced motion preferences)

11. **Optimize Performance**:
    - Implement lazy loading for images
    - Add prefetching for linked pages
    - Optimize bundle size and loading performance

12. **Enhance Dark Mode**:
    - Refine dark mode color palette
    - Ensure all components handle theme switching properly
    - Add smooth transition between themes

## Implementation Approach

For each phase:

1. **Start with Component Design**:
   - Design components on paper/wireframes first
   - Define clear responsibilities and props
   - Identify reusable patterns

2. **Implement Core Functionality**:
   - Start with minimal viable implementation
   - Focus on functionality before styling
   - Write clear component documentation

3. **Apply Styling and Responsiveness**:
   - Implement styling following global CSS patterns
   - Test on multiple screen sizes
   - Ensure consistent with existing components

4. **Test and Refine**:
   - Validate against accessibility guidelines
   - Test with real content and edge cases
   - Refine based on visual comparison with target site

## Lessons Learned
- Vanilla CSS requires more planning for maintainability than utility-first frameworks
- Component-scoped CSS in Svelte helps maintain style isolation
- Custom CSS properties (variables) are essential for building a themeable site
- Media queries require careful planning for responsive breakpoints
- When using Svelte 4, be careful not to use Svelte 5 or SvelteKit features
- Component implementation best practices:
  - Start extremely simple and add complexity gradually
  - Test components in isolation before integration
  - Avoid circular dependencies between components
  - Mock data locally before using complex stores
  - When a component doesn't work, revert to simplest possible version
- Page structure lessons:
  - Keep separate pages as separate components
  - Don't mix homepage and blog page content/layouts
  - Study the reference site carefully to understand the distinct layout needs of each page
- Development workflow:
  - Include info useful for debugging in program output
  - Read files before attempting to edit them
  - Run npm audit when vulnerabilities appear in the terminal
  - Always ask before using -force git commands
- Data management lessons:
  - Store large content outside of JavaScript files when possible
  - Split related data into logical chunks
  - Implement lazy loading for content that isn't needed immediately
  - Consider dynamic imports for better performance
- CSS warnings about unused selectors in BlogPostPage are expected and can be ignored
  - These selectors target dynamically loaded Markdown content
  - Document this in the code to avoid future confusion
- A11y warnings should be addressed promptly
  - Elements with event handlers should be interactive elements or have proper ARIA roles
  - Use proper semantic HTML elements whenever possible
- Having a reference site is extremely valuable for design implementation
  - Study both desktop and mobile layouts separately
  - Pay attention to subtle details like spacing and typography
  - Use browser dev tools to inspect the reference implementation
