## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Projects Section Implementation

The Projects section has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### Project Data Structure

The project data follows a modular system similar to our blog posts:

```
frontend/src/
└── data/
    └── projects/
        ├── index.js             # Central management file for projects
        ├── projects/            # Project metadata files
        │   ├── ravencoin.js
        │   ├── cgc-overseas.js
        │   └── chengda.js
        └── content/             # Detailed content files
            ├── ravencoin.md
            ├── cgc-overseas.md
            └── chengda.md
```

### Components

1. **ProjectsPage.svelte**
   - List view displaying all projects in predefined order
   - Each project shows title, role, location, period, summary, and tags
   - Project items link to their respective detail pages

2. **ProjectDetailPage.svelte**
   - Detailed view of a single project
   - Displays comprehensive metadata including project type, field, and team size
   - Shows achievements as bullet points
   - Features related projects section based on matching tags
   - Includes 'Back to projects' navigation

3. **Project Metadata Structure**
   - Each project has standardized fields (title, role, location, period, slug, etc.)
   - Tags system allows linking related projects
   - Content is stored in separate markdown files for better management

### Utility Functions

Project-specific utility functions have been added to `project-utils.js`:
- `getAllProjects()`: Returns all projects in the configured order
- `getProject(slug)`: Retrieves a specific project by slug
- `formatProjectPeriod(period)`: Formats date periods consistently (e.g., "Jan 2018" → "January 2018")
- `getRelatedProjectsBySlug(slug, limit)`: Finds related projects based on matching tags

### Recent Enhancements

1. **Project Ordering**
   - Projects are now ordered with most recent/ongoing projects at the top
   - Order: Ravencoin (ongoing), Chengda, CGC Overseas

2. **Focus Visibility Improvements**
   - Enhanced focus states for better accessibility
   - Added `:focus-visible` support for keyboard-only focus indicators
   - Removed default focus outlines on mouse clicks while preserving them for keyboard navigation

3. **Chinese Character Handling**
   - Fixed display issues with Chinese characters in project titles

## Language Translation Implementation Plan

After analyzing different approaches, we've determined the best strategy for adding language translation to the blog:

### Recommended Approach: Custom JSON Translation

This approach provides the most reliable solution that works across all browsers, devices, and regions (including China where Google services may be blocked):

1. **Translation Data Structure**
   ```
   frontend/src/
   └── i18n/
       ├── index.js           # Translation store setup
       └── locales/           # Translation files by language
           ├── en.json        # English (default)
           ├── zh.json        # Chinese
           └── ja.json        # Japanese
   ```

2. **Translation Store**
   - Create a Svelte store that manages the current language
   - Dynamically load language files as needed
   - Provide a translation function for easy component usage
   - Persist language selection in localStorage

3. **Language Selector UI**
   - Add a language toggle button next to the theme toggle
   - Show language options with appropriate flags/labels
   - Indicate the currently selected language

4. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Start with translating UI elements (navigation, buttons, labels)
   - Progressively translate content, starting with most important sections
   - For untranslated content, offer a fallback to English

This approach ensures:
- Works on all browsers and devices
- Functions in all regions, including China
- No dependency on third-party services
- Complete control over translation quality
- Best performance without additional scripts

## Comparison with Target Site

After reviewing both the current blog-simplified site at https://blog-simplified.vercel.app/ and our target reference https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/, I've identified the following gaps and opportunities for improvement:

## Revised i18n Implementation Plan

### Analysis of Previous Issues

The first attempt at implementing internationalization encountered several issues:

1. **Raw Translation Keys Displayed**: Navigation items showing "nav.blog" instead of translated text
2. **Translation Dropdown Errors**: Errors when attempting to switch languages
3. **Translation Keys Showing in Components**: Components displaying raw keys like "pages.tags" 
4. **UI Styling Issues**: Incorrect blue underline on nav.blog
5. **Console Errors**: 404 errors when trying to load translation JSON files

These issues were likely caused by several factors:

1. **Dynamic Import Problems**: The async approach to loading translations caused timing issues
2. **Build Process Issues**: JSON files may not have been properly included in the Rollup build
3. **Circular Dependencies**: Potential circular references in the i18n modules
4. **Translation Function Issues**: The reactive `$t` function was not correctly implemented

## Revised Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Simplified i18n Foundation (2-3 hours)

1. **Static Translation Loading**
   - Replace dynamic imports with direct imports in the store.js file
   - Pre-load all translations at build time rather than on-demand
   - Simplify the translation function to avoid async issues

2. **Step-by-Step Implementation**
   - Create a simplified store.js that imports all translations directly
   - Create a synchronous translation function that doesn't rely on async loading
   - Pre-load language from localStorage but without circular dependencies
   - Add proper error handling for missing translations

3. **Build System Adjustments**
   - Ensure JSON files are properly included in the build process
   - Test building with different bundler configurations if needed

### Phase 2: One Component at a Time (1 hour per component)

1. **Start with NavLinks.svelte**
   - Update only this component to use the new translation function
   - Add visible indicators to verify translations are working
   - Test thoroughly with all supported languages

2. **Expand incrementally**
   - After NavLinks works perfectly, move to Footer component
   - Then to Header theme toggle
   - Then to Page titles
   - Add one component at a time with careful testing

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing (2 hours)

1. **Verification Process**
   - Create a standardized testing checklist for all translated components
   - Test on various screen sizes and devices
   - Test with all supported languages

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add robust fallbacks for missing translations
   - Implement proper error reporting for translation issues

## Implementation Details

### 1. Simplified store.js Structure

```javascript
import { writable, derived } from 'svelte/store';
import en from './locales/en.json';
import ja from './locales/ja.json';
import zh from './locales/zh.json';

// Pre-loaded translations
const translations = { en, ja, zh };

// Browser language detection
function getBrowserLanguage() {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return 'en';
  
  const savedLang = localStorage.getItem('language');
  if (savedLang && translations[savedLang]) return savedLang;
  
  const browserLang = navigator.language.split('-')[0];
  return translations[browserLang] ? browserLang : 'en';
}

// Create language store
export const language = writable(getBrowserLanguage());

// Save language preference
language.subscribe(value => {
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    localStorage.setItem('language', value);
  }
});

// Simple language setter
export function setLanguage(lang) {
  if (translations[lang]) {
    language.set(lang);
  }
}

// Translation function
export const t = derived(
  language,
  ($language) => (key, params = {}) => {
    // Handle empty keys
    if (!key) return '';
    
    // Navigate through nested keys (e.g., "nav.blog")
    const keys = key.split('.');
    let value = translations[$language];
    
    // Find translation in current language
    for (const k of keys) {
      value = value?.[k];
      if (!value) break;
    }
    
    // Fallback to English if not found
    if (!value && $language !== 'en') {
      value = translations.en;
      for (const k of keys) {
        value = value?.[k];
        if (!value) break;
      }
    }
    
    // If still no translation, return the key itself
    if (!value) return key;
    
    // Replace parameters
    return value.replace(/\{\{(\w+)\}\}/g, (_, paramName) => 
      params[paramName] !== undefined ? params[paramName] : `{{${paramName}}}`
    );
  }
);

// Helper functions
export const currentLangCode = derived(language, $language => $language);

export function getLanguageName(code) {
  const languages = {
    'en': 'English',
    'ja': '日本語',
    'zh': '简体中文'
  };
  return languages[code] || 'English';
}

// Export supported languages
export function getSupportedLanguages() {
  return [
    { code: 'en', name: 'English' },
    { code: 'ja', name: '日本語' },
    { code: 'zh', name: '简体中文' }
  ];
}
```

### 2. Simplified index.js

```javascript
// Re-export everything from store.js
export { 
  language, 
  setLanguage, 
  currentLangCode, 
  getLanguageName, 
  t,
  getSupportedLanguages 
} from './store.js';
```

### 3. NavLinks.svelte Test Implementation

```javascript
<script>
  import { createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte';
  import { t, language } from '../../i18n';
  
  // Props
  export let currentRoute = '/';
  
  // Event dispatcher
  const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();
  
  // Debug function for testing translations
  function debugTranslation(key) {
    const result = $t(key);
    console.log(`Translation: ${key} => ${result} (lang: ${$language})`);
    return result;
  }
  
  // Navigation items with translation keys
  const navLinks = [
    { key: 'nav.blog', href: '/blog', route: '/blog-list' },
    { key: 'nav.tags', href: '/tags', route: '/tags-list' },
    { key: 'nav.projects', href: '/projects', route: '/projects' },
    { key: 'nav.about', href: '/about', route: '/about' }
  ];
  
  // Check if a link is active
  function isActive(link) {
    if (currentRoute === '/') {
      return link.href === '/';
    }
    
    if (currentRoute === '/blog-post') {
      return link.route === '/blog-list';
    }
    
    if (currentRoute === '/tag') {
      return link.route === '/tags-list';
    }
    
    return currentRoute === link.route;
  }
  
  // Handle link click
  function handleLinkClick() {
    dispatch('linkClick');
  }
</script>

<nav class="nav">
  <!-- Debug language indicator (temporary) -->
  <div class="debug-lang" style="font-size: 0.7rem; color: #999; margin-bottom: 0.5rem; display: none;">
    Current language: {$language}
  </div>
  
  <ul class="nav-list">
    {#each navLinks as link}
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a 
          href={link.href} 
          class="nav-link" 
          class:active={isActive(link)}
          aria-current={isActive(link) ? 'page' : undefined}
          on:click={handleLinkClick}
        >
          {$t(link.key)}
        </a>
      </li>
    {/each}
  </ul>
</nav>

<style>
  /* Keep existing styles */
</style>
```

## Testing Strategy

To ensure the i18n implementation works correctly, we'll follow this testing approach:

### 1. Component-Level Testing

- Test each component individually with the translation function
- Verify translations appear correctly in all supported languages
- Add debug output initially to verify translation function works
- Check for any console errors related to translations

### 2. Integration Testing

- Test language switching across the entire application
- Verify all components update correctly when language changes
- Check for any styling issues when text length changes in different languages
- Test on mobile devices to ensure proper display of translated content

### 3. Regression Testing

- Ensure existing functionality continues to work
- Verify responsive design still works with translations
- Check that no new errors appear in the console

## Lessons for Future Implementation

1. **Keep It Simple**: Start with direct, synchronous approaches before adding complexity
2. **Test Incrementally**: Implement and test one component at a time
3. **Add Debug Information**: Include temporary debug output to verify translations
4. **Watch the Build Process**: Ensure JSON files are properly included in the build
5. **Handle Fallbacks Properly**: Always provide fallbacks for missing translations
6. **Avoid Circular Dependencies**: Be careful with module imports that might create loops

By following this revised plan, we should be able to implement internationalization without encountering the previous issues. The approach is simpler, more direct, and focuses on incremental implementation with thorough testing at each step.

## Internationalization Implementation

We've successfully implemented internationalization in the blog with support for English, Japanese, and Chinese. The implementation follows a simplified approach that prioritizes reliability and performance:

### Implementation Approach

1. **Direct JSON Import Strategy**
   - Used direct imports of JSON translation files instead of dynamic imports
   - Pre-loaded all languages at initialization to avoid async loading issues
   - Configured Rollup with `@rollup/plugin-json` to properly process JSON files

2. **Translation Store Architecture**
   - Created a central Svelte store to manage the current language state
   - Implemented a synchronous translation function that supports:
     - Nested translation keys (e.g., "nav.blog")
     - Parameter substitution (e.g., "{{year}}")
     - Automatic fallbacks to English for missing translations
     - Graceful handling of missing keys

3. **Components Implementation**
   - Updated key components with translation support:
     - Navigation links (header and mobile menu)
     - Footer copyright and attribution text
     - Theme toggle options (Light/Dark/System)
     - Search dialog and button labels
     - Date formatting based on current language

4. **User Preferences**
   - Stored language preference in localStorage
   - Added auto-detection of browser language on first visit
   - Implemented language selector UI with proper accessibility support

### JSON Translation Structure

Each language file follows the same structure with nested keys:

```json
{
  "nav": {
    "blog": "Blog",
    "tags": "Tags", 
    "projects": "Projects",
    "about": "About"
  },
  "ui": {
    "language": "Language",
    "search": "Search",
    "search_placeholder": "Type a command or search...",
    "no_results": "No results found for \"{{query}}\"",
    "content_heading": "CONTENT",
    "start_searching": "Type to start searching...",
    "theme": "Theme",
    "dark": "Dark",
    "light": "Light",
    "system": "System"
  },
  "footer": {
    "copyright": "© {{year}} Sarada's Blog",
    "built_with": "Built with Svelte 4"
  }
}
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **JSON Processing in Rollup**
   - Rollup requires the `@rollup/plugin-json` to properly handle JSON imports
   - JSON files should be placed in the correct import order in the config file

2. **Circular Dependencies**
   - Avoid circular dependencies in i18n modules to prevent build issues
   - The export of `getSupportedLanguages()` was duplicated in both store.js and index.js

3. **Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Loading**
   - For smaller applications, preloading all translations synchronously offers better reliability
   - Async loading may be more appropriate for applications with many languages or large translation files

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test one component at a time when adding translation support
   - Verify all supported languages show correct translations
   - Watch for UI layout shifts when text length changes between languages

### Next Steps

1. **Expand Translation Coverage**
   - Continue translating more UI elements and content sections
   - Implement translations for blog post metadata
   - Add translations for project details pages

2. **Improve User Experience**
   - Add visual indicators for the current language selection
   - Ensure graceful handling of right-to-left languages if added in future
   - Consider adding language-specific URLs (e.g., /zh/blog) for better SEO
