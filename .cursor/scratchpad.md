# Modern Blog with Svelte and Vanilla CSS

## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Codebase Analysis
The existing codebase contains a basic Svelte component (`frontend/src/App.svelte`). We'll build upon this foundation to create our blog. Using Svelte with vanilla CSS offers several advantages:

1. **Lighter Bundle Size**: Without Tailwind's utility classes, our CSS will be more focused and potentially smaller
2. **Svelte's Built-in Reactivity**: Svelte's compile-time approach results in highly optimized DOM updates
3. **Simpler Learning Curve**: Vanilla CSS is familiar to most developers without requiring knowledge of Tailwind's utility-first paradigm
4. **Complete Styling Control**: Custom CSS allows pixel-perfect implementation without constraints of a framework

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Content Management**: Implementing MDX or a similar solution for Svelte to handle blog content
2. **Routing and Navigation**: Setting up SvelteKit or a routing library to handle blog pages and navigation
3. **Styling System**: Creating a maintainable CSS architecture without Tailwind's utility classes
4. **Static Site Generation**: Implementing SSG capabilities with Svelte/SvelteKit 
5. **SEO and Social Sharing**: Ensuring proper metadata and social sharing without Next.js's built-in features
6. **Code Syntax Highlighting**: Adding syntax highlighting for code blocks in blog posts

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Set up SvelteKit for routing and SSG capabilities
   - Success Criteria: A working SvelteKit application with routing functionality
2. Create a clean CSS architecture (possibly using CSS custom properties)
   - Success Criteria: A base stylesheet with variables, reset, and core components
3. Set up MDsveX (MDX for Svelte) or alternative content solution
   - Success Criteria: Ability to render Markdown content in Svelte components

### Phase 2: Core Blog Components
1. Create basic layout components (header, footer, layout)
   - Success Criteria: Basic structure of the blog with consistent layout using vanilla CSS
2. Implement responsive navigation with CSS
   - Success Criteria: Mobile-friendly navigation that collapses on smaller screens using CSS media queries
3. Build blog list/grid view components
   - Success Criteria: Page showing a list of blog posts with titles, dates, and summaries
4. Create blog post detail page template
   - Success Criteria: Individual post pages rendering Markdown content correctly

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
1. Add syntax highlighting for code blocks using Prism or Highlight.js
   - Success Criteria: Code blocks in blog posts have proper syntax highlighting
2. Implement light/dark mode toggle with CSS variables
   - Success Criteria: Theme switching functionality with persistent user preference
3. Add pagination for blog posts
   - Success Criteria: Blog list pages with working pagination
4. Set up tags/categories system
   - Success Criteria: Ability to filter blog posts by tags/categories

### Phase 4: SEO and Performance
1. Implement metadata and SEO optimization with Svelte components
   - Success Criteria: Proper meta tags for all pages and blog posts
2. Add social sharing capabilities
   - Success Criteria: Social media preview cards working correctly
3. Optimize images and asset loading
   - Success Criteria: Improved page loading performance with optimized assets
4. Implement analytics integration
   - Success Criteria: Working analytics to track user behavior

### Phase 5: Final Touches and Deployment
1. Create about page and other static pages
   - Success Criteria: Complete set of pages for the blog
2. Set up continuous deployment
   - Success Criteria: Automatic deployment pipeline configured
3. Final testing and optimization
   - Success Criteria: All features working correctly with good performance metrics
4. Deploy to production
   - Success Criteria: Live blog accessible to users

## CSS Architecture Approach
Instead of Tailwind's utility classes, we'll implement a thoughtful CSS architecture:

1. **CSS Custom Properties**: For theming, responsive values, and maintaining consistency
2. **Component-Based CSS**: Styles scoped to Svelte components using Svelte's style encapsulation
3. **Global Styles**: A minimal set of global styles for typography, layout utilities, and reset
4. **Media Queries**: For responsive design rather than Tailwind's responsive utility classes
5. **CSS Animations**: For interactive elements and transitions
6. **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: For layout without relying on utility classes

## Lessons
- Vanilla CSS requires more planning for maintainability than utility-first frameworks
- Component-scoped CSS in Svelte helps maintain style isolation
- Custom CSS properties (variables) are essential for building a themeable site
- Media queries require careful planning for responsive breakpoints
- Testing across browsers is even more important with custom CSS
