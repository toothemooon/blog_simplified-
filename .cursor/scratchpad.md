## Background and Motivation
The goal is to build a modern blog similar to https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/blog but using Svelte 4 for the framework and vanilla CSS for styling instead of Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This approach will leverage the existing Svelte codebase while still creating a clean, responsive blog with good performance.

## Projects Section Implementation

The Projects section has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### Project Data Structure

The project data follows a modular system similar to our blog posts:

```
frontend/src/
└── data/
    └── projects/
        ├── index.js             # Central management file for projects
        ├── projects/            # Project metadata files
        │   ├── ravencoin.js
        │   ├── cgc-overseas.js
        │   └── chengda.js
        └── content/             # Detailed content files
            ├── ravencoin.md
            ├── cgc-overseas.md
            └── chengda.md
```

### Components

1. **ProjectsPage.svelte**
   - List view displaying all projects in predefined order
   - Each project shows title, role, location, period, summary, and tags
   - Project items link to their respective detail pages

2. **ProjectDetailPage.svelte**
   - Detailed view of a single project
   - Displays comprehensive metadata including project type, field, and team size
   - Shows achievements as bullet points
   - Features related projects section based on matching tags
   - Includes 'Back to projects' navigation

3. **Project Metadata Structure**
   - Each project has standardized fields (title, role, location, period, slug, etc.)
   - Tags system allows linking related projects
   - Content is stored in separate markdown files for better management

### Utility Functions

Project-specific utility functions have been added to `project-utils.js`:
- `getAllProjects()`: Returns all projects in the configured order
- `getProject(slug)`: Retrieves a specific project by slug
- `formatProjectPeriod(period)`: Formats date periods consistently (e.g., "Jan 2018" → "January 2018")
- `getRelatedProjectsBySlug(slug, limit)`: Finds related projects based on matching tags

### Recent Enhancements

1. **Project Ordering**
   - Projects are now ordered with most recent/ongoing projects at the top
   - Order: Ravencoin (ongoing), Chengda, CGC Overseas

2. **Focus Visibility Improvements**
   - Enhanced focus states for better accessibility
   - Added `:focus-visible` support for keyboard-only focus indicators
   - Removed default focus outlines on mouse clicks while preserving them for keyboard navigation

3. **Chinese Character Handling**
   - Fixed display issues with Chinese characters in project titles

## Language Translation Implementation Plan

After analyzing different approaches, we've determined the best strategy for adding language translation to the blog:

### Recommended Approach: Custom JSON Translation

This approach provides the most reliable solution that works across all browsers, devices, and regions (including China where Google services may be blocked):

1. **Translation Data Structure**
   ```
   frontend/src/
   └── i18n/
       ├── index.js           # Translation store setup
       └── locales/           # Translation files by language
           ├── en.json        # English (default)
           ├── zh.json        # Chinese
           └── ja.json        # Japanese
   ```

2. **Translation Store**
   - Create a Svelte store that manages the current language
   - Dynamically load language files as needed
   - Provide a translation function for easy component usage
   - Persist language selection in localStorage

3. **Language Selector UI**
   - Add a language toggle button next to the theme toggle
   - Show language options with appropriate flags/labels
   - Indicate the currently selected language

4. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Start with translating UI elements (navigation, buttons, labels)
   - Progressively translate content, starting with most important sections
   - For untranslated content, offer a fallback to English

This approach ensures:
- Works on all browsers and devices
- Functions in all regions, including China
- No dependency on third-party services
- Complete control over translation quality
- Best performance without additional scripts

## Comparison with Target Site

After reviewing both the current blog-simplified site at https://blog-simplified.vercel.app/ and our target reference https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/, I've identified the following gaps and opportunities for improvement:

### What We've Accomplished
- ✅ Basic layout structure mirroring the target site

- ✅ Mobile navigation slide-in menu
- ✅ Projects section with metadata and related projects
- ✅ Custom 404 page with proper routing configuration
- ✅ Footer with social media links matching target site design
- ✅ Responsive footer with properly displayed icons on all screen sizes

### What's Missing Compared to Target Site

1. **Pagination**:
   - Target site has pagination for the blog list
   - Our implementation shows all posts on a single page
   - This becomes critical as content grows and page load time increases

2. **Newsletter Subscription**:
   - Target site has a newsletter subscription component in the footer
   - Our site lacks this engagement feature for building audience

3. **Code Block Styling**:
   - Target site has syntax highlighting for code blocks with language detection
   - Our implementation has basic code styling without language-specific highlighting
   - Target site offers code copying functionality

4. **Series/Collection Display**:
   - Target site organizes related posts into series with navigation
   - Our Ravencoin series exists but lacks a dedicated series landing page
   - Target site has clear navigation between posts in a series

5. **Visual Polish**:
   - Target site has more refined spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
   - Our site has the basics but could use more visual refinement
   - Animations and transitions are more polished on the target site

6. **Website Metadata**:
   - Target site has proper SEO metadata, favicons, and social sharing images
   - Our implementation is missing proper OpenGraph tags and Twitter cards
   - Target site has better document head management

7. **Author Profiles**:
   - Target site has more detailed author information with dedicated pages
   - Our implementation has basic author information without dedicated pages

8. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Target site has image optimization and lazy loading
   - Our implementation loads all images immediately
   - Target site has better bundle splitting and resource management

9. **Internationalization**:
   - Target site supports multiple languages
   - Our site currently only supports English

## Component Review Guidelines

When implementing new components or features, follow these review steps:

1. **Directory Structure Analysis** - Understand how components are organized
2. **Component Implementation Patterns** - Follow established patterns for script, markup, and styles
3. **Dependency Analysis** - Check for shared utilities and avoid circular dependencies
4. **CSS Methodology** - Use project's CSS variables and follow naming conventions
5. **Responsive Design Approach** - Use established breakpoints (375px, 480px, 640px, 1024px)

For styling components, use the project's standard breakpoint pattern:
```css
/* Mobile first base styles */
.component { ... }

/* Tablet (640px+) */
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .component { ... }
}

/* Desktop (1024px+) */
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  .component { ... }
}
```

## Lessons Learned
- Vanilla CSS requires more planning for maintainability than utility-first frameworks
- Component-scoped CSS in Svelte helps maintain style isolation
- Custom CSS properties (variables) are essential for building a themeable site
- Media queries require careful planning for responsive breakpoints
- When using Svelte 4, be careful not to use Svelte 5 or SvelteKit features
- Component implementation best practices:
  - Start extremely simple and add complexity gradually
  - Test components in isolation before integration
  - Avoid circular dependencies between components
  - Mock data locally before using complex stores
  - When a component doesn't work, revert to simplest possible version
- Page structure lessons:
  - Keep separate pages as separate components
  - Don't mix homepage and blog page content/layouts
  - Study the reference site carefully to understand the distinct layout needs of each page
- Development workflow:
  - Include info useful for debugging in program output
  - Read files before attempting to edit them
  - Run npm audit when vulnerabilities appear in the terminal
  - Always ask before using -force git commands
- Data management lessons:
  - Store large content outside of JavaScript files when possible
  - Split related data into logical chunks
  - Implement lazy loading for content that isn't needed immediately
  - Consider dynamic imports for better performance
- CSS warnings about unused selectors in BlogPostPage are expected and can be ignored
  - These selectors target dynamically loaded Markdown content
  - Document this in the code to avoid future confusion
- A11y warnings should be addressed promptly
  - Elements with event handlers should be interactive elements or have proper ARIA roles
  - Use proper semantic HTML elements whenever possible
- Having a reference site is extremely valuable for design implementation
  - Study both desktop and mobile layouts separately
  - Pay attention to subtle details like spacing and typography
  - Use browser dev tools to inspect the reference implementation
- Focus management lessons:
  - Use `:focus-visible` for keyboard-only focus indicators
  - Ensure clickable elements have proper hover states even without focus outlines
  - Target specific elements rather than making global focus changes
- Content optimization:
  - Ensure consistent data patterns across similar content (projects, blog posts)
  - Format dates and other metadata consistently
  - Create utility functions for common formatting tasks
- Translation considerations:
  - Google Translate is not accessible in China (a key audience for Chinese translation)
  - Custom JSON translations provide better quality and reliability
  - Start with UI elements, then progressively translate content
  - Consider region-specific needs when implementing features
- SPA routing configuration:
  - Client-side routing requires proper server configuration
  - The sirv server needs the `--single` flag to handle SPA routing correctly
  - For production deployments, modify vercel.json to ensure proper SPA routing
  - Testing routes that don't exist is crucial for verifying 404 handling
- SVG icon considerations:
  - For solid icons, use `fill="currentColor"` instead of `stroke="currentColor"`
  - Provide clear accessibility attributes (aria-label) for icon-only links
  - Optimize icon paths for cleaner rendering
  - Consider icon size and spacing for proper visual balance
- Social media link implementation:
  - Always use `rel="noopener noreferrer"` with `target="_blank"` for security
  - Test links with actual accounts to ensure they work properly
  - Maintain consistent visual style across different platform icons
  - Group similar links together for better organization
- Responsive design for icon layout:
  - Decrease spacing (gap) on smaller screens to prevent awkward wrapping
  - Use fixed sizing for clickable elements to maintain proper touch targets
  - Implement multiple breakpoints for progressive enhancement
  - Test on a variety of small screen sizes, not just common breakpoints

## Next Implementation: Pagination for Blog List

Based on our current progress and comparison with the target site, implementing pagination for the blog listing is the highest priority task. As content grows, displaying all blog posts on a single page will lead to performance issues and poor user experience.

### Requirements Analysis

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - Display a limited number of blog posts per page (e.g., 10 posts)
   - Provide navigation controls to move between pages
   - Show current page number and total pages
   - Support direct URL access to specific pages (e.g., `/blog-list?page=2`)

2. **UI Components Needed**:
   - Pagination controls component
   - Updated BlogListPage to support pagination
   - "Previous" and "Next" buttons
   - Page number indicators

3. **Data Handling**:
   - Slice the blog posts array based on current page
   - Calculate total number of pages
   - Handle edge cases (first page, last page)
   - Maintain current query parameters when changing pages

### Technical Design

#### 1. Data Structure and Utilities

Add pagination utilities to `blog-utils.js`:

```javascript
/**
 * Get paginated blog posts
 * @param {Array} posts - Array of blog posts
 * @param {Number} page - Current page number (1-based)
 * @param {Number} postsPerPage - Number of posts per page
 * @returns {Object} - Object containing paginated posts and pagination metadata
 */
export function getPaginatedPosts(posts, page = 1, postsPerPage = 10) {
  const totalPosts = posts.length;
  const totalPages = Math.ceil(totalPosts / postsPerPage);
  
  // Ensure page is within valid range
  const currentPage = Math.max(1, Math.min(page, totalPages || 1));
  
  // Calculate start and end indices
  const startIndex = (currentPage - 1) * postsPerPage;
  const endIndex = Math.min(startIndex + postsPerPage, totalPosts);
  
  // Slice the posts array
  const paginatedPosts = posts.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
  
  return {
    posts: paginatedPosts,
    pagination: {
      currentPage,
      totalPages,
      postsPerPage,
      hasPrevPage: currentPage > 1,
      hasNextPage: currentPage < totalPages,
    }
  };
}
```

#### 2. Component Updates

1. **Create Pagination Component**:

Create a new component `frontend/src/components/blog/Pagination.svelte`:

```svelte
<script>
  // Props
  export let currentPage = 1;
  export let totalPages = 1;
  export let baseUrl = '/blog-list';
  export let queryParams = {};
  
  // Generate an array of page numbers to display
  $: pageNumbers = generatePageNumbers(currentPage, totalPages);
  
  function generatePageNumbers(current, total) {
    if (total <= 7) {
      // Show all pages if total is small
      return Array.from({ length: total }, (_, i) => i + 1);
    }
    
    const pages = [];
    
    // Always show first page
    pages.push(1);
    
    // Show current page and neighbors
    const startPage = Math.max(2, current - 1);
    const endPage = Math.min(total - 1, current + 1);
    
    // Add ellipsis after first page if needed
    if (startPage > 2) {
      pages.push('...');
    }
    
    // Add pages around current page
    for (let i = startPage; i <= endPage; i++) {
      pages.push(i);
    }
    
    // Add ellipsis before last page if needed
    if (endPage < total - 1) {
      pages.push('...');
    }
    
    // Always show last page
    if (total > 1) {
      pages.push(total);
    }
    
    return pages;
  }
  
  // Generate URL for a specific page
  function getPageUrl(page) {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(queryParams);
    params.set('page', page);
    return `${baseUrl}?${params.toString()}`;
  }
</script>

<nav class="pagination" aria-label="Blog pagination">
  <ul class="pagination-list">
    <!-- Previous Button -->
    <li class="pagination-item">
      <a 
        href={getPageUrl(currentPage - 1)} 
        class="pagination-link" 
        class:disabled={currentPage === 1}
        aria-label="Go to previous page"
      >
        <span aria-hidden="true">←</span> Prev
      </a>
    </li>
    
    <!-- Page Numbers -->
    {#each pageNumbers as pageNum}
      <li class="pagination-item">
        {#if pageNum === '...'}
          <span class="pagination-ellipsis">…</span>
        {:else}
          <a 
            href={getPageUrl(pageNum)} 
            class="pagination-link" 
            class:active={pageNum === currentPage}
            aria-label={pageNum === currentPage ? `Current page, page ${pageNum}` : `Go to page ${pageNum}`}
            aria-current={pageNum === currentPage ? 'page' : undefined}
          >
            {pageNum}
          </a>
        {/if}
      </li>
    {/each}
    
    <!-- Next Button -->
    <li class="pagination-item">
      <a 
        href={getPageUrl(currentPage + 1)} 
        class="pagination-link" 
        class:disabled={currentPage === totalPages}
        aria-label="Go to next page"
      >
        Next <span aria-hidden="true">→</span>
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<style>
  .pagination {
    margin: 2rem 0;
    width: 100%;
  }
  
  .pagination-list {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 0.5rem;
  }
  
  .pagination-item {
    margin: 0 0.25rem;
  }
  
  .pagination-link {
    display: inline-flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    min-width: 2.5rem;
    height: 2.5rem;
    padding: 0 0.75rem;
    border-radius: 0.25rem;
    text-decoration: none;
    font-size: 0.875rem;
    color: var(--color-text);
    border: 1px solid var(--color-border);
    transition: all 0.2s ease;
  }
  
  .pagination-link:hover:not(.disabled):not(.active) {
    background-color: rgba(var(--color-primary-rgb), 0.1);
    color: var(--color-primary);
  }
  
  .pagination-link.active {
    background-color: var(--color-primary);
    color: white;
    border-color: var(--color-primary);
  }
  
  .pagination-link.disabled {
    opacity: 0.5;
    pointer-events: none;
  }
  
  .pagination-ellipsis {
    display: inline-flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    min-width: 2.5rem;
    height: 2.5rem;
    color: var(--color-text);
    opacity: 0.7;
  }
  
  @media (min-width: 640px) {
    .pagination-list {
      gap: 0.75rem;
    }
  }
</style>
```

2. **Update BlogListPage.svelte**:

Modify `frontend/src/components/blog/BlogListPage.svelte` to support pagination:

```svelte
<script>
  import { onMount } from 'svelte';
  import { getAllBlogPosts, getPaginatedPosts } from '../../utils/blog-utils.js';
  import Pagination from './Pagination.svelte';
  
  let allPosts = [];
  let paginatedData = { posts: [], pagination: { currentPage: 1, totalPages: 1 } };
  let isLoading = true;
  let postsPerPage = 10;
  let currentPage = 1;
  
  onMount(() => {
    // Get current page from URL
    const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    currentPage = parseInt(params.get('page') || '1', 10);
    
    // Load blog posts
    allPosts = getAllBlogPosts();
    updatePagination();
    isLoading = false;
    
    // Listen for URL changes (browser back/forward)
    window.addEventListener('popstate', handlePopState);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('popstate', handlePopState);
    };
  });
  
  function handlePopState() {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    currentPage = parseInt(params.get('page') || '1', 10);
    updatePagination();
  }
  
  function updatePagination() {
    paginatedData = getPaginatedPosts(allPosts, currentPage, postsPerPage);
  }
</script>

<div class="blog-list-page">
  <h1 class="page-title">All Blog Posts</h1>
  
  {#if isLoading}
    <div class="loading">Loading posts...</div>
  {:else}
    <div class="blog-list">
      {#each paginatedData.posts as post}
        <!-- Existing post rendering code -->
      {/each}
    </div>
    
    <Pagination 
      currentPage={paginatedData.pagination.currentPage} 
      totalPages={paginatedData.pagination.totalPages}
      baseUrl="/blog-list"
    />
  {/if}
</div>
```

#### 3. URL Parameter Handling

To ensure proper URL parameter support, the server and router must be configured:

1. Update `main.js` to handle URL parameters in client-side routing
2. Ensure `vercel.json` has the appropriate rewrites for SPA routing

### Implementation Steps

1. **Research and Planning** (1 hour)
   - ✅ Study the target site's pagination implementation
   - ✅ Plan the component structure
   - ✅ Design the pagination utility functions

2. **Pagination Utility Functions** (1 hour)
   - Add `getPaginatedPosts` function to `blog-utils.js`
   - Write tests to ensure function works correctly
   - Handle edge cases properly

3. **Pagination Component Creation** (1 hour)
   - Create the `Pagination.svelte` component
   - Style it to match the target site design
   - Make it responsive for all screen sizes

4. **Integration with BlogListPage** (1 hour)
   - Update BlogListPage to use the new pagination functions
   - Add state management for current page
   - Ensure URL parameters are properly handled

5. **Testing and Refinement** (1 hour)
   - Test pagination on different screen sizes
   - Verify that URL parameters work correctly
   - Ensure no regression in existing functionality

### Success Criteria
