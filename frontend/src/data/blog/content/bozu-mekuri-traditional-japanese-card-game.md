# Bozu Mekuri: A Traditional Japanese Card Game of Flipping Monks

Among Japan's many traditional games, there is a simple yet delightful card game called Bozu Mekuri (坊主めくり, "Flipping Monks"). This game uses the Hyakunin Isshu karuta cards and is a traditional entertainment activity that Japanese children have been familiar with since childhood, embodying a unique combination of poetry and gameplay in Japanese culture.

## Origin and Background

Bozu Mekuri uses the "Hyakunin Isshu" cards, a deck containing one hundred waka poems by poets from the Heian period. Each card features a portrait of the poet and their representative work. While Hyakunin Isshu itself is a cultural tool for learning waka poetry, clever Japanese people transformed it into a game suitable for all ages, allowing children to be exposed to classical literature through play.

The game's name "Bozu Mekuri" literally translates to "Flipping Monks," derived from the key character in the game—the image of monks in robes. Among the character cards in Hyakunin Isshu, some poets were Buddhist monks, depicted with shaved heads, and these cards play a special role in the game.

## Game Rules and Gameplay

The rules of Bozu Mekuri are simple and clear, making it very suitable for family gatherings. At the start of the game, all cards are shuffled face down and stacked in the center. Players take turns flipping cards from the top of the pile, receiving different outcomes based on the character depicted:

### Three Key Characters

**Men (殿, Tono)**: When a card with an ordinary male poet is flipped, the player may keep the card. This is the most common situation in the game, as players gradually accumulate their own pile of cards.

**Monks (坊主, Bozu)**: This is the game's turning point! When a player unfortunately flips a monk card, they must forfeit all the cards they have collected so far, returning them to the discard pile. This sudden setback often elicits exclamations from players and is the most thrilling part of the game.

**Princess (姫, Hime)**: When a card with a female poet is flipped, the player not only keeps the card but also claims all the cards in the discard pile! This is the game's "lifeline," capable of instantly turning the tables for a trailing player.

## The Game's Appeal

The charm of Bozu Mekuri lies in its simple yet unpredictable nature. You might have just accumulated a dozen cards, only to lose them all in the next moment by flipping a monk; or you might flip a princess in a moment of despair and instantly become the player with the most cards. This dramatic reversal keeps the game in a constant state of tension and joy.

The game requires no complex strategy or skill and relies entirely on luck, so even three or four-year-old children can compete equally with adults. This fairness makes it a popular choice for Japanese family New Year gatherings and holiday celebrations.

## Cultural Significance and Educational Value

Although Bozu Mekuri seems like just a simple game of chance, it actually serves a function of cultural transmission. Children naturally encounter the poet images from Hyakunin Isshu during gameplay and develop an interest in Japanese classical literature. Many Japanese people recall this game when reminiscing about their childhood—it has become part of Japan's cultural memory.

The game's classification of monks, men, and women also reflects the social structure in Japanese historical culture. Through the game, children can learn about aristocratic life in the Heian period and recognize that although female poets were fewer in number during that era, they were equally respected and esteemed.

## Modern Preservation

In today's era of electronic games, Bozu Mekuri continues to be passed down in Japanese households. Many schools also introduce this game in cultural courses, allowing students to approach classical literature in a relaxed manner. At the same time, developers have released mobile app versions, enabling this traditional game to continue thriving in the digital age.

Bozu Mekuri is not just a game—it is a bridge connecting Japanese traditional culture with modern life, a joyful memory passed down through generations. No matter how times change, the exclamation "Bozu ga deta!" (A monk appeared!) will continue to resound in Japanese homes, bringing laughter and warmth.
