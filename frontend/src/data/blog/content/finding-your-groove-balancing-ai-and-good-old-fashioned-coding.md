# Finding Your Groove: Balancing AI and Good Old-Fashioned Coding

I've been thinking a lot lately about this vibe coding thing lol. Giving your vibe to your code sounds pretty cool, right? 
But there's definitely a sweet spot between obsessing over every detail and blindly throwing tasks at the AI.

## The Balancing Act

When I dive into vibe coding, I often find myself bouncing between two extremes. Ask too many precise planning before implementation, and the AI loses the context completely—
it's like forgetting why you walked into a room haha. Move too fast without giving clear direction, and boom—runtime errors usually follows very fast! Kinda frustrating.

So, what's the trick? How do we make AI a helpful teammate without driving ourselves nuts?

## Finding a Rhythm

Usually I use this tidy little "plan-do-plan-do" cycle (think CI/CD). Every step neatly organized and independent, ideally no surprises(often not). Maybe vibe coding with AI needs this approach too—clear, bite-sized tasks each step of the way.

I recently stumbled onto a podcast featuring one of Cursor's founders, and honestly, it was a breath of fresh air. He talked about the importance of a 'good taste' on visuals and logic to build awesome products. Couldn't agree more:

1. **AI's Magic**: Clearly understanding what AI rocks at and what it just... doesn't.
2. **Chunk It Up**: Splitting projects into tiny, manageable bits for easy wins and steady progress.

## The Community Debate

On top of that, scrolling through discussions on X, the whole debate on vibe coding really caught my attention. Some people fully embrace AI; others totally underestimate it, fearing it might spoil the learning experience. It made me wonder—what actually matters more: the journey of learning or quickly pushing out a product and getting early feedback?

## Personal Journey

Personally, I've spent years stuck in an endless loop of tutorials and frameworks, sometimes overwhelmed by the complexity of something as "simple" as rendering single page but have shit ton of codes behind it. Seeing other people's incredible projects on GitHub used to make me feel inadequate, asking myself, "How on earth did they pull that off while I stuck on simple things?"

But here's what I've figured out: coding isn't just about mastering syntax or theory. It's moving from worrying about tiny details to handling abstract ideas and solving real-world problems. Yes, theory matters, but honestly, consistent delivering and dedication on something that real people use is way more satisfying.

## The Vibe Matters

A great problem-solving attitude, or maybe a joyful upfront mood, the vibe—like the one a good product manager has lmao—often beats obsessing over tech details. 
Especially now, AI shaking things up! They are shaping the world as we know it today.

Whether or not falling into the vibe coding rabbit hole, the path we take, the lesson we learnt, can be power of others, can be the way we moving forward.
